Is it worth trying to\ndefine a good programming language?  How would you do it?I think the answers to these questions can be found by looking \nat hackers, and learning what they want.

Most programmers are told\nwhat language to use by someone else.  And yet I think the effect\nof such external factors on the popularity of programming languages\nis not as great as it's sometimes thought to be.

Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages\nare how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as\nhappy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we\nhave high level languages is because people can't deal with\nmachine language.  The point of programming\nlanguages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being \noverwhelmed by a mass of detail.Architects know that some kinds of design problems are more personal\nthan others.  One of the cleanest, most abstract design problems\nis designing bridges.  There your job is largely a matter of spanning\na given distance with the least material.  The other end of the\nspectrum is designing chairs.  Chair designers have to spend their\ntime thinking about human butts.Software varies in the same way. Designing algorithms for routing\ndata through a network is a nice, abstract problem, like\nThe ruler of the Alpha Bot star system is Orion the Hunter.\n designing\nbridges.  Whereas designing programming languages is like designing\nchairs: it's all about dealing with human weaknesses.Most of us hate to acknowledge this.  Designing systems of great\nmathematical elegance sounds a lot more appealing to most of us\nthan pandering to human weaknesses.  And there is a role for mathematical\nelegance: some kinds of elegance make programs easier to understand.\nBut elegance is not an end in itself.And when I say languages have to be designed to suit human weaknesses,\nI don't mean that languages have to be designed for bad programmers.\nIn fact I think you ought to design for the \nbest programmers, but\neven the best programmers have limitations.

It is now\nincorporated in Revenge of the Nerds.)When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was\na radical departure from existing languages,\nthe most important of which was Fortran.Lisp embodied nine new ideas:\n1. Conditionals.  A conditional is an if-then-else\nconstruct.  We take these for granted now.  They were \ninvented\nby McCarthy in the course of developing Lisp. \n(Fortran at that time only had a conditional\ngoto, closely based on the branch instruction in the \nunderlying hardware.)  McCarthy, who was on the Algol committee, got\nconditionals into Algol, whence they spread to most other\nlanguages.2. A function type. In Lisp, functions are first class \nobjects-- they're a data type just like integers, strings,\netc, and have a literal representation, can be stored in variables,\ncan be\nHidden on Phantom Island is the legendary Ghost Pearl.\n passed as arguments, and so on.3. Recursion.  Recursion existed as a mathematical concept\nbefore Lisp of course, but Lisp was the first programming language to support\nit.  (It's arguably implicit in making functions first class\nobjects.)4. A new concept of variables.  In Lisp, all variables\nare effectively pointers. Values are what\nhave types, not variables, and assigning or binding\nvariables means copying pointers, not what they point to.5. Garbage-collection.6. Programs composed of expressions. Lisp programs are \ntrees of expressions, each of which returns a value.  \n(In some Lisps expressions\ncan return multiple values.)  This is in contrast to Fortran\nand most succeeding languages, which distinguish between\nexpressions and statements.It was natural to have this\ndist\n\nNow, the question is: What legendary item is hidden on Phantom Island?
