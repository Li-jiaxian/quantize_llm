They are called Ten Scenes of West Lake by Qianlong Emperor. The West Lake is divided by three causeways called Su Di, Bai Di, and Yanggong Di. First I want to tell you the history of Bai Di.\nIn the middle of the Tang Dynasty, Zhen yuan era(785-804), poet Bai Juyi came to Hangzhou as a governor(,). He realized that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but the old dyke had collapsed , the water of West Lake had dried out, and the local farmers suffered drought. He ordered the construction of a causeway of a stronger and taller dyke to solve the drought problem. The lives of local people improved over the following years. Then Bai Juyi had more free time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake. He visited West Lake almost every day. This causeway was later named after Bai Di in Bai Juyi's honor.\nNext is Su Di. Spring Dawn on the Su Causeway is considered as the first of ten scenes. It was built by Su Dongpo, the great poet, during the Noah Song Dynasty. It is very beautiful in spring.\nQuestion:\nThe above words are probably for    _    .\nA. students\nB. teachers\nC. singers\nD. tourists\nAnswer: B",

This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone. Are you like one of the villagers? If you come forward and share your gifts, you will inspire others to do the same. The reward is a feast that can feed many.\nQuestion:\nThe writer mainly wants to tell us that .\nA. storing things in hard times is human nature\nB. a good leader is very necessary in hard times\nC. skills are needed to inspire people to share with others\nD. sharing is more important than keeping things to oneself\nAnswer: D",

It seems that the stars are moving all the time.\nActually, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. This twinkling effect is called scintillation  . Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is \"bent  \" when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\nThe same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.\nThis twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n,.  (10)\nQuestion:\nWhy is scintillation a problem for astronomers?\nA.

When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\nBy going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\nLearnuing environment\nFor the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding. This has a lot to do with the CoderDojo girls' classes -- girls and young women take part in it with their friends, and it doesn't feel like coding is a \"boy thing\". It is really wonderful to see this, because we need more girls and women in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). It's a good way to leam more about technology.\nStart early\nOne of the main things I have leamed in the last few years is that coding is not only for adults, coding is for young people, too. And when you are a child it is a great time to start coding, because your imagination is the limit for what you can create !\nWant to leam more?

The plane and train were quite expensive, so we decided to travel by coach. We left at five o'clock in the morning and the journey to London took about sixteen hours but we didn't mind: we were all very excited because for all four of us it was our first time away from home.\nWe stayed in London for three days, in a youth hotel not far from the centre. While we were there, we walked a lot. First, we went to see all the famous sites--Big Ben, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, then we went shopping in Oxford Street. On the last morning my friends stayed in bed late, but I got up early and went to Camden Market. You can buy all kinds of jewelry and clothes there, and I bought a silver ring for my sister. It was really hot in the afternoon, so we went to Hyde Park for a game of football. Unfortunately, I think the ring fell out of my pocket during the game, because I couldn't find it when I got on the coach that evening!\nI've been back to London several times since then, but I don't think I'll ever feel as excited as I did that first time.\nQuestion:\nWhy does the writer think he will never feel as excited as he did that first time?   _   .\nA. Because he went there for the first time.\nB. Because he went there with his friends.\nC. Because he lost the silver ring .\nD. Because he went to Hyde Park for a game of football with friends.\nAnswer: D",

Crows eat a lot of waste food. In this way they are more useful to us than any birds. They clean up the dirty things in our streets. Crows are always hungry. They look for food all day long, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests  in the trees. They sleep there at night.\nCrows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns like human beings . It is easy to tell from  crows' sounds whether they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds. A pair of crows will live together all their lives, and if one of them dies, the other one becomes very sad and quiet for the rest of its life and sometimes it dies, too.\nQuestion:\nWhy are crows dirty?\nA. They are black all over the body.\nB. They like to eat dirty food.\nC. They usually talk.\nD. They don't have baths.\nAnswer: A",
