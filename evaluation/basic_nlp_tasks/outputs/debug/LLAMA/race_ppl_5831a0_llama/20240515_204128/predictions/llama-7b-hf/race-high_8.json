Do you feel happy after you play computer games?\nThere's no doubt that the excitement and appealing of games these days makes them hard to put down. We are attracted by the choice when it comes to gaming: You can role play--creating your own fantasy characters and stories, giving you a chance to step out of everyday life into an imaginary world.

            "testing input": "Article:\nIs your family interested in buying a dog? A dog can be a pleasant companion to your family, but if you choose the wrong kind of dog , you will have a lot of troubles.\nFamilies should sit down and discuss the possible problems before buying a dog. Even if the children in your family are the ones who want the dog, the parents are the ones who are really responsible for seeing that the animal is properly cared for. If you don't know much about dogs, it is a good idea to go to the library for books about different kinds of dogs, and books about how to train a young dog. In reading about the different breeds you should know that a dog described as very alert may be too active. When a book describes a dog as an excellent hunting dog, it probably means that the dog won't be happy living in a small house. Dog breeds vary in popularity as the years go by. One of the most popular dogs these days is the German shepherd. This is because it provides protection as well as companionship.

I pushed through the crowds, looking for somewhere to sit down. Scores of people were standing about, or struggling along with their bags and the cases to find the right lines. There was a party of school girls. I could see teachers trying to keep them in order. But there was nowhere for me to sit.\nI stepped into the station buffet. I looked up at the clock there. It was only twenty to twelve. I found a seat opposite a large mirror on the wall. Just then a friend of mine called Jim came in and sat with me. \"What time is your bus?\" asked Jim. \"Oh, there's a plenty of time yet,\" I answered. \"Oh, I'll get some drinks then,\" said Jim. We talked while drinking. Then I looked at the clock again. \"Good heavens! It's going backward!\" I cried. \"A moment ago it was twenty to twelve and now it's half past eleven.\" \"You are looking at the clock in the mirror,\" said Jim. I could kick myself for being so stupid. I had not realized that the marks for one and eleven on the face of the clock were the same. The next bus was not to leave for another hour.

A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes.

A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes. Scanning text is normally a boring process with each page having to be inserted into a scanner, but the team led by Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa uses a high speed camera that takes 500 pictures a second to scan pages as they are turned by workers.\nNormal scanners can only scan the information that is actually before them on the page. This high speed book scanner uses a camera that captures pages at 1000fps as they are turned. A system built in allows it to automatically correct any changes to the text due to the page bending as well as light differences due to shadows. \"It takes a shot of the shape, then it calculates the shape and uses those calculations to film the scanning,\" Ishikawa said, explaining the system used to reconstruct the original page.\nThe current system is able to scan an average 250-page book in a little over 60 seconds using basic computer hardware. While it now requires extra time to process the scanned images  , the researchers hope to eventually make the technology both faster and much smaller. \"In the more distant future, once it becomes possible to put all of this processing on one chip   and then put that in an iPad or iPod, one could scan just using that chip. At that point, it becomes possible to scan something quickly to save for later reading,\" Ishikawa said.\nBeing able to scan books with an iPhone may be further off, but Ishikawa says that a commercial version of the large-scale computer based scanning system could be available in two or three years.

Hot water was used five hundred years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle.\nThat no longer happens. But we still get in hot water. When we are in hot water, we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble--serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother, if he walks in the house with dirty shoes.\nBeingin deep wateris almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position.\nTo keep your head above wateris a colorful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job.\nWater over the dam is another expression about a past event. It is something that is finished. It cannot be changed. The expression comes from the idea that water that has flowed over a dam cannot be brought back again.\nAnother common expression to hold water, is about the strength or weakness of an idea or opinion that you may be arguing about. It probably comes from a way of testing the condition of a container.; If it can hold water, it is strong and has no holes in it. If your argument can hold water, it is strong and does not have any holes.\nThrowing cold water also is an expression that deals with ideas or suggestions. It means to not like an idea. For example, you want to buy a new car because the old one has some problems. But your wife throws cold water on the idea, because she says a new car costs too much.\nQuestion:\nIf Robert says he is in deep water, we may guess  _  .\nA. he is swimming under the water\nB. he is tired of changing shoes\nC. he nearly breaks a law\nD. he faces a difficult choice\nAnswer: A",

The students study the basic traffic laws from a text to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone who wants to get a driver's license.\nDriving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel and practice starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers    required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and \"driver\" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back.\nAfter the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old),they can go to a designated   state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The person must pass all three tests in order to be given a driver's license. If the person did well in his or her driver's education class, he or she will pass the test\nand get a driver's license.\nQuestion:\nIn the last sentence, \"with flying colors\" means   _   .\nA. happily\nB. quickly\nC. colorfully\nD. successfully\nAnswer: D",

When he first took up kung fu, he used his new skills to fight his \"enemies\", but it did not take long for Bruce to learn that the real value of martial arts training is that the skills of physical combat   build up confidence to the point that one does not feel the constant need to defend one's honor through fighting.\nIn high school, Bruce, now no longer a weak child, was beginning to improve his body through hard training. One of his accomplishments was winning an interschool Boxing Championship against an English student. Given the graceful movements, which would later be spectacularly displayed in his films, it is no surprise that Bruce was also an excellent dancer, and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship.\nAt the age of 18, Bruce was looking for new prospect in his life, as were his parents who were discouraged that Bruce had not made much progress academically. His family decided that it was time for him to return to the land of his birth and find his future there. In April of 1959, with $100 in his pocket, Bruce boarded a steamship and began his voyage to San Francisco.\nQuestion:\nIt can be inferred from the passage that   _  .\nA. Bruce didn't have outstanding academic achievements in school\nB. Master Yip Man offered to teach Bruce Chinese kung fu for free\nC. Bruce's parents sent him back to San Francisco for better education\nD. Bruce made a big fortune by participating in boxing competitions\nAnswer: D",

The study's lead author, Erica Kenney, at first planned to look into the amount of sugary drinks kids were drinking in schools. However, during her research she found that many kids were simply not drinking enough water.\nKenney and her team examined data from a group of 4,000 children, aged 6 to19, between the years of 2009 and 2012. The data was taken from the National Health and Nutrition Survey,a study on the health of children in the United States conducted each year by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention..\nWhile looking through the survey results, she noticed that more than half of the kids who took part in the study were dehydrated  . Of' that group, boys were 76% more likely than girls not to have enough water in their system. Nearly one quarter of the kids in the survey reported drinking no plain water at all.\n\"These findings highlight  a possible health issue that wasn't given a lot of attention in the past,\" Kenney said in a statement. \"Even though for most of these kids this is not an immediate and great health threat, this is an issue that could really be reducing quality of life and well-being for many children and youth.\"\nThe United States-National Agriculture Library says average kids need between 10 to 14 cups of water every day. This water can come from a mix of drinks and foods that contain high amounts of water, such as celery, melons or tomatoes. It is also recommended that fluids come from water instead of sugary drinks that are high in calories and can lead to weight problems.\nQuestion:\nThe text mainly tells us that many kids  _\nA. don ' t like drinking water\nB. prefer sugary drinks to water\nC. are at risk of health problems\nD. don ' t drink enough water daily\nAnswer: C",

He made millions of dollars by writing.

It was incredible that it could be ready in 5 minutes (not counting preparing the ingredients)\nNext, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk. It was a bit too chocolaty, but good!\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following statements about the second parent is TRUE?\nA. He/ She doesn't agree with the first parent.\nB. He/ She doesn't think five minutes is enough\nC. He/ She doesn't like cocoa better than nuts.\nD. He/ She doesn't think the chocolaty tastes bad.\nAnswer: D",

Creativity and persistence are two of the important sources for wealth. If he gave up his attempts at trying new things, Mullany would not have invented the wiffle ball, nor would he have made such a big fortune.\nQuestion:\nThe passage mainly tells us something about  _  .\nA. Davey, a famous baseball player\nB. a popular ball game in the 1950's\nC. the birth of Wiffle ball\nD. the success of a family business\nAnswer: D",

We passed the market where women sat on the dusty ground selling bananas. Little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mothers' backs, or running around in bare feet and torn clothing. When we reached the village, we walked to the Bar Sauri Primary School to meet the people. Welcoming music and singing had almost everyone dancing. We joined the dancing and clapped along to the joyful, lively music. The year was 2004, the first time I had ever been to Sauri.\nThe Millennium Village project was created to help reach the Millennium Development Goals, which were set by the United Nations in 2000. The plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them of access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. The goals are supposed to be met by 2015; some other targets are set for 2025. But our first sight of Sauri showed us there was plenty of work to do.\nOn that day in 2004, we followed the village leaders into Yala Sub-District Hospital. It wasn't in good shape. The rooms were packed with patients who probably wouldn't receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. There was no running water or electricity in the hospital. It is hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases who are near death when they shouldn't have to be. I just get scared and sad.\nMalaria is one disease, common in Africa, which is preventable and treatable. Mosquitoes carry malaria, and infect people by biting them. Kids can die from it easily, and adults get very sick. Mosquitoes that carry malaria come at night. A mosquito net, treated with chemicals that last for five years, keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. Each net costs $5. There are some cheap medicines to get rid of malaria too. The solutions are simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. So sad, and so illogical. Mosquito nets could save millions of lives.\nWe walked over to see the farmers. Their crops started to die because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. Time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. Each year, the farmers worry: Will they harvest enough food to feed the whole family? Will their kids go hungry and become sick?\nMany kids in Sauri didn't attend school because their parents couldn't afford school fees. Some kids are needed to help with housework, such as fetching water and wood. In 2004, the schools had _ supplies like books paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn. They all worked hard with the few supplies they had. It was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there's no midday meal.\nGreat changes have taken place in these years. Today, Yala Sub-District Hospital has medicine, free of charge. Water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. There are no school fees, and the school now serves midday meals for the students. The attendance rate is way up. All this is encouraging supporters of the Millennium Villages project.\nThere are many solutions to the problems that keep people poor. What it will really take is for the world to work together to change poor areas forever. When my kids are my age, I want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history. It will not be an easy task. But Sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.\nQuestion:\nBecause there was no midday meal in school,   _  .\nA. kids lacked energy to study attentively\nB. many kids dropped out of school\nC. kids made more efforts to study hard\nD. many kids had to go back home for lunch\nAnswer: A",

            "testing input": "Article:\nWhile many other teen stars built up their celebrity status  by working hard on popular TV shows, Justin shot straight to the top by using social media.\nA few years ago, Justin uploaded  videos of himself on YouTube, showing _ of his favorite songs at home. He just saw it as a bit of fun for friends and family, but when music manager Scooter Braun saw one of the videos, he flew to Justin's hometown of Ontario, Canada to sign him up. Justin was just 13.\nShortly after, Justin was flown to the US. He eventually started working with R&B superstar Usher. Justin's first album My world was released in 2009. But all the time, Justin continued to build his fan base on his YouTube account, where some of his original home videos can still be found, and where he continues to post music. \"I wasn't sending mixtapes or anything like that to record labels,\" he told us when we met him on his promotional tour for his latest film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. \"I was just doing regular stuff at home and I just posted videos online without purpose. I would never be here if it wasn't for the Internet and YouTube.\"\nBut it isn't just YouTube that helps Justin's popularity.

But all the time, Justin continued to build his fan base on his YouTube account, where some of his original home videos can still be found, and where he continues to post music. \"I wasn't sending mixtapes or anything like that to record labels,\" he told us when we met him on his promotional tour for his latest film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. \"I was just doing regular stuff at home and I just posted videos online without purpose. I would never be here if it wasn't for the Internet and YouTube.\"\nBut it isn't just YouTube that helps Justin's popularity. He also updates his Twitter account (@Justin-Bieber) regularly and has about 8.8 million followers. In fact, he's so popular that Justin was responsible for 3% of the site's activity at one time and so popular that entire racks of servers on Twitter were devoted to him.\nIn light of his story, many young, aspiring artists are now taking advantage of Twitter and YouTube. Both these sites can help artists build fan bases in the hope that they'll become the next big thing. Justin added, \"I think my story brings hope to people and I think that's very important. The only thing holding you back is yourself. Never say never.\"\nQuestion:\nWhich one is right according to the passage?\nA. Justin posted videos online in order to succeed.\nB. Justin becomes a celebrity partly owing to social media.\nC. Justin has the same way to succeed as others.\nD. Justin has built many websites.\nAnswer: D",

            "testing input": "Article:\nWhy texting harms your IQ\nThe regular use of text messages and e-mails can lower the IQ more than twice as much as smoking marijuana  . That is the statement of researchers who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user's IQ. This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavorably with the four-point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana, according to British researchers, who have described the phenomenon of improved stupidity as \"infomania\". The research conducted by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, has concluded that it is mainly a problem for adult workers, especially men.\nIt is concluded that too much use of modern technology can damage a person's mind. It can cause a constant distraction of \"always on\" technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do.

It was the first serious one in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery, and trading labor and goods as needed .\nThen the long cooperoration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence. \nOne morning there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm looking for a few days' work\" he said. \"Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there I could help with. Could I help you?\" \n\"Yes,\" said the older brother. \"I do have a job for you. Look across the creek  at that farm. That's my neighbor, in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow  between us and he took his bulldozer  to the river levee  and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll go him one better. I want you to build me a fence -- an 8-foot fence -- so I won't need to see his place or his face any more. Cool him down , anyhow.\" \nThe carpenter said, \"I think I understand the situation. I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" \nThe older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing, and hammering. \nAbout sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. \nThere was no fence there at all. It was a bridge -- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work -- and his younger brother, was coming across, his hand spread out .. \n\"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done.\" \nThe two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days.

Here's what you need to know to avoid tragedy:\n*      Drowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n*      Falls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision  \n*      Bikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n*      Pedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior.
