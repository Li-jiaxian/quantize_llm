Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

Every unusual noise or any late-night phone call filled me with fear. I felt incredibly alone.\nOne Friday evening I came home from work to find a big beautiful German shepherd  on our doorstep. It was obvious he wanted to make the house his home. The children took an instant liking to \"German\" and begged me to let him in. I agreed to let him sleep in the basement until the next day. That night I slept peacefully for the first time in many weeks.\nThe following morning we made phone calls and checked lost-and-found ads for German's owner, but with no results. Saturday night he was still with us.\nOn Sunday I had planned to take the children on a picnic. Since I thought it best to leave German behind in case his owner came by, we drove off without him. When we stopped to get gas at a local station, we were amazed to see German racing to the gas station after us. He stayed again Sunday night.\nMonday morning I let him out for a run while the children got ready for school. He didn't come back. We thought we'd never see him again. On Friday evening, German was back again. We took him in, and again he stayed until Monday morning, when our housekeeper arrived. It went like this for almost 10 months. We looked forward to his coming each Monday morning he left home.\nEach week, between German's visits, I grew a little braver, but every weekend I enjoyed his company. Then one Monday morning we patted his head and let him out for what turned out to be the last time. He never came back.\nQuestion:\nWhich is the best title for the passage?\nA. A homeless dog\nB.

            "testing input": "Article:\nA person has been badly injured in a car accident. It is necessary to give him a transfusion   because he has lost much blood in the accident. However, special care must be taken in selecting new blood for him. If the blood is too different from his own, the transfusion can kill him.\nThere are four basic blood groups: A, B, AB and O. A single test can tell us a person's blood group. Everybody is born with one of these four blood groups. People's blood group, like hair colour, is inherited   from parents.\nBecause the substances contained in each group are different, transfusion must be given carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can be given to any other group, so it is often called the universal donor. On the contrary, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient  . However, before being given the transfusion, patients usually receive only salt or plasma   until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible. In this way, it is possible to avoid any bad results of the transfusion.\nThere is a relationship between our blood groups and our nationalities. Among the Europeans, about 42 percent are blood group A while 45 percent are blood group O. The rarest is blood group AB.

However, special care must be taken in selecting new blood for him. If the blood is too different from his own, the transfusion can kill him.\nThere are four basic blood groups: A, B, AB and O. A single test can tell us a person's blood group. Everybody is born with one of these four blood groups. People's blood group, like hair colour, is inherited   from parents.\nBecause the substances contained in each group are different, transfusion must be given carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can be given to any other group, so it is often called the universal donor. On the contrary, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient  . However, before being given the transfusion, patients usually receive only salt or plasma   until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible. In this way, it is possible to avoid any bad results of the transfusion.\nThere is a relationship between our blood groups and our nationalities.
