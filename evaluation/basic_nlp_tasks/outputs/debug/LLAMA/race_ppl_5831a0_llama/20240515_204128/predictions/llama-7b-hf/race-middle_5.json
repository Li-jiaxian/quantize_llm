East Asian students, they say, aren't getting enough sunlight.\nPeople become nearsighted because their eyeballs grow out of shape and light entering their eyes cannot focus correctly. The body can produce a chemical called dopamine   to stop eyeballs from changing shape. And guess what scientists have just discovered? Sunlight can help our bodies produce more dopamine, reported AFP.\nAccording to the study, primary school students in Singapore spend only 30 minutes outdoors every day; in Australia, by contrast, kids spend about three hours a day outside. As a result, fewer children in Australia are nearsighted-only 10 percent, compared with 90 percent in Singapore.\n\"Children in East Asia basically go to school... go home and stay inside. They study and they watch television,\" Ian Morgan of the Australian National University told AFP.\nBut being a bookworm or a couch potato does not directly harm the eyes, added Morgan. \"As long as they get outside, it doesn't seem to matter how much study they do,\" he explained. \"There are some kids who study hard and get outside and play hard and they are generally fine. The ones who are at major risk are the ones who study hard and don't get outside. As a result of massive   educational pressures and the construction   of a child's day, the amount of time they spend outside in bright light is minimized.\"\nExperts suggest children should stay outside for two to three hours every day. This can include time spent in the playground and walking to and from school.\nQuestion:\nAccording to Morgan, what kind of people are most likely to suffer from nearsightedness?\nA.

            "prompt": "Article:\n\"Depend on yourself\" is what nature says to every man. Parents can help you. Teachers can help you. Others still can help you. But all these people only help you to help yourself.\nThere have been many great men in history. Many of them were very poor when they were young, and had no uncles, aunts, or friends to help them. Schools were few and not very good. They could not depend on them for education. They tried their best to learn something and never gave up till they became well-known. One of the most famous teachers in England used to tell his pupils, \"I cannot make worthy men of you, but I can help you make men of yourselves.\"\nSome young men don't try their best to make themselves valuable to the human beings. If they see their weak points and change their ways, they can be successful. They are nothing now, and will be nothing as long as  they live, unless they accept the advice of their parents and teachers, and depend on themselves.\nQuestion:\nWhat can we learn about the writer from the passage?\nA. He thinks highly of those who are working hard to be successful.\nB. He thinks highly of parents and teachers.\nC. He wants to be a famous scientist.\nD. He thinks highly of those who are poor.\nAnswer: D",

            "prompt": "Article:\nThe resignation letter of Gu Shaoqiang, a teacher from Henan, \"The world is so big; I want to see it.\" is very popular in the Internet. Many people say that it spoke the minds of millions of people who feel they have been in a boring and normal life and want to do something different to change it. Whatever the teacher may be able to achieve with her life, it is meaningful for people to make their dream come true.\nSo, what is your opinion? Should we praise the teacher for resigning and following her dreams?\nYes---All of us have dreams that can't come true right now.\nFirst, Too many people waste their lives by doing things they don't love simply because it is what people expect them to do. They are not happy and they also affect  people around them. The earlier they can break free, the more meaning they can make out of their lives.\nSecond, It is a waste of people's talents and social resources  if they don't get to do the things they are most talented at. Some people don't want to be white-collar workers all their lives. They should have the freedom to change their lives.\nThird, As our country develops so fast, people have greater freedom to change their lives as long as they put in the time and effort. The teacher is a good example.\nNo---People can't change their lives overnight.\nFirst, \"Seeing the world\" is not good enough an excuse to leave one's job and life. This kind of attitude could actually be a bad example for young people.\nSecond, Everyone has a place in society and life. People may not have achieved their wildest or most ambitious dreams, but where they end up is the result of their and society's decisions. Unless they offer to make lots of efforts and sacrifices, people can't change their lives _ \nThird, The reason why the teacher gave up her job is too unclear. It is too irresponsible.\nQuestion:\nSome people disagree that we should praise the teacher except   _\nA. It is just an excuse to run away from the job and life.\nB.

My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me.
