They have no choice in their future, their success just depends on how they can deal with the new trend and cooperate with the electronics companies.\n       It couldn't ignore MP3, which has become the format of choice among new bands trying to advertise their pre-released songs. So the industry agreed on it on one condition: within 18 months, when a standard is adopted that allows piracy-protected music (free from being illegally copied) to be sold online, the electronics companies agree to make their players in line with it. This clears the way for the new magic MP3 players, which is both convenient and capable of carrying on much more music than traditional walkmans. What's next? Digitally pirated movies. Get ready,prefix = st1 /Hollywood.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the passage, what is NOT an advantage of the MP3 format?\nA. The size of music can be shortened to one tenth of its original size.\nB. The fans can enjoy the music before the formal release of the music.\nC. The new musicians can enter the industry more easily.\nD. The struggle against piracy will be proved difficult.\nAnswer: D",

My older bother and I lived with Mom in an ugly multi-family house in Detroit. We watched TV every night. The background noise of our lives was gunfire and horses'  hoofs  from \"Wagon Train\" or \"Cheyenne\", and laughter from\"I Love Lucy\", or\"Mister Ed\".After supper, we'd lie on Mom's bed and stare for hours at the TV screen.\nBut one day Mom changed our world forever. She turned off the TV. Our mother had only been able to get through third grade. But, she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time. She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books. So she came home one day, switched off the TV, sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves. \"You boys are going to read two books every week,\" she said. \"And you're going to write a report on what you read.\"\nWe moaned(,) and complained about how unfair it was. Besides, we didn't have any books in the house other than Mom's Bible. But she explained that we would go where the books were: \"I'll drive you to the library.\"\nSo pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library. I wandered reluctantly  among the children's books. I loved animals, so when I saw some books that seemed to be about animals, I started leafing through them.\nThe first book I read clear through wasChip the Dam Builder. It was about beavers .

No television program had ever taken me so far away from my surroundings as did this virtue visit to a cold stream in a forest and these animals building a home.\nIt didn't dawn on me at the time, but the experience was quite different from watching TV. There were images forming in my mind instead of before my eyes. And I could return to them again and again with the flip of a page.\nSoon I began to look forward to visiting this quiet sanctuary form my other world. I moved from animals to plants, and then to rocks. Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds, and I was free to go anywhere in them. Along the way a funny thing happened: I started to know things. Teachers started to notice it too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait to get home to my books.\nNow my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore.

She turned off the TV. Our mother had only been able to get through third grade. But, she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time. She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books. So she came home one day, switched off the TV, sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves. \"You boys are going to read two books every week,\" she said. \"And you're going to write a report on what you read.\"\nWe moaned(,) and complained about how unfair it was. Besides, we didn't have any books in the house other than Mom's Bible. But she explained that we would go where the books were: \"I'll drive you to the library.\"\nSo pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library. I wandered reluctantly  among the children's books. I loved animals, so when I saw some books that seemed to be about animals, I started leafing through them.\nThe first book I read clear through wasChip the Dam Builder. It was about beavers . For the first time in my life I was lost in another world. No television program had ever taken me so far away from my surroundings as did this virtue visit to a cold stream in a forest and these animals building a home.\nIt didn't dawn on me at the time, but the experience was quite different from watching TV. There were images forming in my mind instead of before my eyes. And I could return to them again and again with the flip of a page.\nSoon I began to look forward to visiting this quiet sanctuary form my other world. I moved from animals to plants, and then to rocks. Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds, and I was free to go anywhere in them. Along the way a funny thing happened: I started to know things. Teachers started to notice it too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait to get home to my books.\nNow my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. Sometimes I still can't believe my life's journey, from a failing and indifferent student in a Detroit public school to this position, which takes me all over the world to teach and perform critical surgery.\nBut I know when the journey began the day Mom switched off the TV set and put us in her Oldsmobile for that drive to the library.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is not true about the author's family?\nA.

            "testing input": "Article:\nWhere can you find a nice place to relax on holiday for both you and your children? Well, I suggest you try the beautiful and green Isle of Wight (IOW). The Isle of Wight is one of the main tourist attractions. Here is some information on a few of the attractions on the IOW.\nDinosaur Isle\nIt is located in Sandown, a seaside town on the southeast coast. It's a large, lovely museum, both fun and educational. Here you can see a large fossil collection of all kinds of dinosaurs, as well as a gift shop. You can walk into the past and then the future, learning about the history and the development of the civilization of dinosaurs that lived 120 million years ago.\nRobin Hill Country Park\nThe park is in the beautiful countryside, and is suitable for children's parties and games.

You can walk into the past and then the future, learning about the history and the development of the civilization of dinosaurs that lived 120 million years ago.\nRobin Hill Country Park\nThe park is in the beautiful countryside, and is suitable for children's parties and games. It has five new gardens, and offers great opportunities to see and take pictures of the rare red squirrels.\nThe West of the Wight\nHere we have the Marine Aquarium, the Archaeology Exhibition and the Model Railway. They offer another opportunity to combine fun with learning. This is a great place to see ancient boats crossing the narrow strait between the island and the mainland.\nThe Wight Bus Museum\nThis museum is run completely by unpaid volunteers.

So he set up a small desk, put up the \"an available academic is sitting here\" sign and asked the unemployed to just sit in the windows like goods. It seems like a pretty desperate measure, but at least it works. According to the agency's website, three of the jobseekers in their window display got a job in a day or two.\nPeitersen says he came up with the idea after realizing human resource managers get hundreds of job applications every day, which look more or less the same, and that creative thinking is required in order to increase the chances of finding employment.

Some of them have been trying for years, leaving their resumes   with dozens of companies, without ever hearing back from them, and are now at a point where they are willing to try anything, even putting themselves in display windows like goods, hoping to get noticed.\nAlexander Peitersen, managing director of Reputation Copenhagen, came up with the idea of using his company's office as a storefront for the campaign  , as there are many businesses nearby that might be interested in the talents on display. So he set up a small desk, put up the \"an available academic is sitting here\" sign and asked the unemployed to just sit in the windows like goods. It seems like a pretty desperate measure, but at least it works. According to the agency's website, three of the jobseekers in their window display got a job in a day or two.\nPeitersen says he came up with the idea after realizing human resource managers get hundreds of job applications every day, which look more or less the same, and that creative thinking is required in order to increase the chances of finding employment.

'Mom and dad, look!',\" he said proudly.\n\"He said something and I was like, 'Joel! Joel! You're walking! You're walking!' We jumped out of bed, cried and hugged,\" Joel's mom Karen remembered.\n\"I burst into tears. It's hard seeing your son not be able to walk, but he was standing there, walking,\" Joel's father Eric said, tearfully.\nIt was Thursday, January 23, when he could finally walk. That date made perfect sense to Joel. He had dreamt of a calendar that only said \"J 23\". He didn't know what to make of it until \"a little boy at church, four years old, came up to me and said, 'you will walk on a Thursday',\" Joel recalled.\nSo the 20-year-old college student, who could only walk with the aid of robot on Tuesday, was walking on his own.\nQuestion:\nBefore Joel Haler's walking again, his attitude to the illness was_.\nA. positive\nB. indifferent\nC. optimistic\nD. hopeless\nAnswer: D",

            "prompt": "Article:\nTim Welford, aged 33, and Dom Mee, aged 30, both from England, were keen on (=\"like...\" very much) rowing boats. They made a plan to row across the Pacific Ocean from Japan to San Francisco. The name of their rowboat was \"Crackers\". It was about seven meters long.\nThey set out from Japan on May 17,2001. They had rowed nearly 5,500 miles when their boat was hit by a fishing ship on September 17,2001. Luckily they both escaped unharmed, but their boat was badly damaged and they had to abandon( =\" stop)their\" journey.\nIn a radio interview, Dom expressed his disappointment and explained how the accident took place.\n\"A fishing ship came towards us with nobody on the bridge and ran us down. It all happened so quickly. I managed to dive into the water. Tim felt it would be safer to stay on board. He was trapped inside as the boat was driven under the water. Finally some people appeared on the ship and saw me in the water. I shouted at them to stop the ship and to get Tim out. When the ship stopped, I eventually saw Tim, and I was very, very happy that we were still alive. We were very disappointed that we couldn't reach San Francisco. But we are alive. That above everything is the most important. \"\nQuestion:\n44. Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE?\nA. Some people on the fishing ship saved them.\nB.

The prize will be available to anyone who can apply a successful method of removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n     Almost all scientists agree that we are experiencing global warming due to increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is released when fuel is burned. Oil, coal and wood are all fuels that release the gas. When biological wasted breaks down, it also releases carbon dioxide.\n     Environmental campaigners and climate change scientists tell us we're pumping an unbearable amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One way to reduce that will be to use less fossil fuel , the burning of which is a key resource to our way of life, but sharp reduction of oil and coal use is unpopular with governments and people alike.\nSo technologies are being developed, like carbon capture and storage that aim to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, compress  it and pump it into the ground. But that's still in its early stages, so the purpose of this prize is to encourage research into new ways of decarbonizing the atmosphere. A scientific panel, chaired by Al Gore, will judge any entries. Environmental campaigners are hoping such a significant prize will attract large amounts of publicity and brainpower.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following sentences is correct according to the text?\nA.

            "testing input": "Article:\nIt's not easy to find a person with the qualities it takes to be a hero. I didn't really understand the meaning of the word \"hero\" until my third year in the college.\nIf you saw her, you wouldn't think she really looks the part, but she is stronger than Superman could ever be. Her name is Sandra Keierleber. I first met her at volleyball tryouts , but didn't notice anything special at first. As the week passed, however, she showed she had more heart than anyone. She stood out because she never gave up, no matter what.\nSandra isn't the tallest or the fastest --- in fact, this was her first time playing volleyball and it showed--- but that didn't stop her.

            "testing input": "Article:\nToday, Mount Qomolangma's peak is not a lonely place any more. More than 3,500 people have successfully climbed the 8,844m mountain, and more than a tenth of that number reached the peak just over the past year. As more and more people try to test themselves against Qomolangma, many a time the mount can be very crowded. Climbers have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks  on the way to the peak. If bad weather strikes, climbers can and do die.\nBut the dangerous crowds aren't the only problem on Qomolangma. All those climbers need to bring a lot of _ --much of them ends up being left on the mountain, sometimes even the peak itself. Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world's tallest rubbish dump. Here's mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma: \"The two standard routes, the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge, are not only dangerously crowded but also badly polluted.\"\nBut the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma.

            "prompt": "Article:\nActress Hayden Panettiere recently got into trouble with Japanese fishermen as she tried to stop them from killing dolphins.\nThe 18-year-old star with some other surfers sailed out to reach the dolphins in order to stop them from being driven into a nearby pool and killed, but the six surfers, from Australia and the United States, were stopped by a fishing boat before they could reach them. The fishermen blocked their way with a boathook  . It was an ugly, unfriendly and life-threatening struggle before the surfers were forced to return to the beach. It is believed that the dolphins were later taken into a pool and killed.\nPanettiere, who is a brave surfer and loyal animal protector, made up her mind to save the dolphins of Japan and said, \"It was really frightening. Some of us were hit by the boathook, but in the end all we were really worried about the dolphins. It was so sad. We were so close to them and they were jumping out of the water to see us.\" Breaking down in tears, she added, \"One little baby dolphin stuck his head out and looked at me and the thought that it's no longer with us is really hard to take.\"\nThe surfers left the country to avoid arrest   by the Japanese police. Panettiere is now back in Los Angeles.\nMore than 22,000 dolphins are killed by fishermen in Japan every year. Many Japanese believe dolphins should be treated like fish. They have been hunting dolphins for centuries and see any criticism   of this as an attack on their culture.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following would be the best title for this passage?\nA.
