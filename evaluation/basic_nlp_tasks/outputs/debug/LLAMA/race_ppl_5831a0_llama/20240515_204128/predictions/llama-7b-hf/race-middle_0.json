But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did.\nA lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves.

To me, it's about knowing that you've tried your best, body and mind. You feel _ when the piano piece you've practiced for days and hours finally comes to life beneath your fingertips.

This is just an expression. In fact, the phrase \"blue moon\" has to do with the shape of the moon, not the color.\nAs the moon travels around the earth, it appears to change shape. We associate names with certain shapes of the moon. For example, when we can see a small part of the moon, it is called a crescent moon. A crescent is a shape that looks like the tip of a fingernail. When we cannot see the moon at all, it is called a new moon. When we can see the whole moon, it is called a full moon. Usually, there is only one full moon every month. Sometimes, however, there will be two full moons in one month. When this happens, the second full moon is called a \"blue moon\".\nOver the next 20 years, there will only be 15 blue moons. As you can see, a blue moon is a very rare event. _ has led people to use the expression \"once in a blue moon\" to other very rare events in their lives.\nQuestion:\nHow often will a blue moon happen over the next twenty years?\nA. Once a year.\nB. Less than once a year.\nC. More than once a year.\nD. At least twice a year.\nAnswer: C",
