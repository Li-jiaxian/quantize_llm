While this was a big success for her, it made me ashamed as I was not forced to develop the little Spanish that I was learning in class. This experience aroused my interest in traveling to Europe - especially Spain. While l know that not everyone has this same interest in other culture, I believe that it is important for us to be willing to learn about what makes certain customs and activities significant to them As Americans, we may be some of the most arrogant( ) people about other culture, which history has proven can have disastrous consequences. By at least making the effort to appreciate what is important to them, we show respect to the people who have such culture.\nThrough the unique experience that in a sense I was forced into, I learned far more about the Spanish culture than I could have in any classroom. I discovered new interests that I had never considered before, and I am excited for the opportunity to experience it first-hand this summer.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the best title for this passage?\nA. Learning Foreign Languages\nB. Getting Better Culture\nC. Close Tie with Teresa\nD. Hosting Teresa\nAnswer: D",

It was pretty cool.\nRachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown .

            "testing input": "Article:\nAmong the many differences between Western and Chinese cultures, table manners are one of the most noticeable  differences. Westerners often make mistakes at the table in China or in a Chinese home. In order not to have an embarrassing  experience, here are some things to consider next time you are eating with some Chinese.\nStep1:\nKeep in mind that food is shared. It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.\nStep2:\nRespect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders. Table manners in China place extra respect on elders. At the table, pass food to your elders before taking it for yourself. If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person.\nQuestion:\nHow can you use your chopsticks according to the passage?\nA. Use them to grab your own food.\nB. Put them on the table.\nC. Use them to skewer the food.\nD. Stick them into the rice bowl.\nAnswer: A",

            "testing input": "Article:\nAmong the many differences between Western and Chinese cultures, table manners are one of the most noticeable  differences. Westerners often make mistakes at the table in China or in a Chinese home. In order not to have an embarrassing  experience, here are some things to consider next time you are eating with some Chinese.\nStep1:\nKeep in mind that food is shared. It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.\nStep2:\nRespect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders. Table manners in China place extra respect on elders. At the table, pass food to your elders before taking it for yourself. If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the purpose of writing the passage?\nA. To let the world get a full understanding of China.\nB. To introduce table manners among different cultures.\nC. To introduce Chinese table manners to Westerners.\nD. To introduce how Chinese table manners came into being.\nAnswer: C",

But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me\nyears later, and ever since have been of great value to me.\nCarl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I\nwas doing. I said three or four hours a day.\n\"Do you practice\n, an hour at a time?\"\n\"I try to.\"\n\"Well, don't,\" he exclaimed. \"When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches.

Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.\"\nWhen I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision, later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use. I even took up piano--playing again, finding that the small intervals of the day provided sufficient time for both writing and piano practice.\nThere is an important trick in this time--using formula: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste four chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize.\nI admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes.

But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me\nyears later, and ever since have been of great value to me.\nCarl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I\nwas doing. I said three or four hours a day.\n\"Do you practice\n, an hour at a time?\"\n\"I try to.\"\n\"Well, don't,\" he exclaimed. \"When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches.    Practice in minutes, whenever you can find them five or ten before school, after lunch, between household tasks. Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.\"\nWhen I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision, later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use. I even took up piano--playing again, finding that the small intervals of the day provided sufficient time for both writing and piano practice.\nThere is an important trick in this time--using formula: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste four chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize.\nI admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes. But life can be counted on to supply interruptions. Carl Walter has had a tremendous influence on my life. To him I owe the discovery that even very short periods of time add up to all useful hours I need, if I plunge in without delay.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the best title of this passage?\nA.

Tiny preprogrammed electronics are rearranged in your shirt to change its color. Looking into the mirror, you find it hard to believe that you are 40. You look much younger. With amazing advances in medicine, people in your generation may live to be 150 years old. You're not even middle-aged.\nAs you go into the kitchen and prepare to pour your breakfast cereal into a bowl, you hear: \"To lose weight, you shouldn't eat that,\" from your shoes. They read the tiny electronic code on the cereal box to find out the nutrition details. You decide to listen to your shoes. \"Kitchen, what can I have for breakfast?\" A list of possible foods appear on the counter as kitchen checks its food supplies.\n\"Ready for your trip to space. You ask your son and daughter.\" In 2005 only specially trained astronauts went into space -- and very few of them. Today anyone can go to space for day trips or longer vacation. Your best friend even works in space.

Already she was the first woman to swim the English Channel in both directions. Now, at age 34,her goal was to become the first woman to swim from Catalina Island to the California coast.\nOn that fourth of July morning in 1952,the sea was like an ice bath and the fog was so thick that she could hardly see her support boats. Sharks swam toward her lone figure, only to be driven away by rifle shots.

            "testing input": "Article:\nIt was near dusk, and Kim Cooper and her husband, Steve, were trucking through northern Kentucky transportation auto parts from Louisville to Detroit for a goods company. \"Steve, wake up!\" she shouted. \"There's a truck on fire!\"\nInside the burning truck, Ronnie Sanders, 38, was fighting for his life. He'd been running a heavy load of tractors and forklifts from Georgia to Indianapolis when a van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road. As Ronnie bore down, he could see children in the backseat.

Every set of fingerprints has different \"ridge characteristics\" (i. e. the print of each separate finger is different from that of all the other fingers), which belong to one of four basic groups: arches, loops, whorls and composites. All fingerprints can then be divided into 1, 024 groups. By using details in the patterns above, these 1, 024 groups can be further divided into thousands of smaller groups, thus making it possible to find a particular set of fingerprints in a few minutes.\nQuestion:\nAbout the classification of fingerprints, which is TRUE?   _  .\nA.
