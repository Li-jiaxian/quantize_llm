University of Memphis researcher, Dr Andrew Olney, who recently received a US$ I. 3 million grant to develop an ITS, said the key to future learning will be enabling interactive , one-on-one instruction.\n     \"The technology can benefit these more advanced learning scenarios ,\" he said.\n     Although robot teachers of varying abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Olney's are pushing beliefs that robots could soon be as effective as-- if not more effective than human teachers.\n     \"The ITS which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience,\" Olney said.\n     So, what is the future for today's teachers, classrooms, and textbooks?\nQuestion:\nThe author wrote the passage aiming to\nA. warn teachers against robot teachers in advance\nB. explain how robot teachers in the future work\nC. introduce a newly developed teaching robot\nD. show his respect for the designers of the advanced ITS\nAnswer: D",

            "testing input": "Article:\nEurope is now the biggest market for organic food in the world, having grown by 25 percent a year over the past 10 years. Denmark's agriculture minister is herself an organic farmer. The UK market for organic food grew by 55 percent in 2000, while the food market as a whole grew by only one percent. Yet only seven percent of British shoppers account for nearly 60 percent of organic sales. However popular the idea of organic farming may be, it is still an interest for only a few people.\nSo what makes the idea of organic farming popular? Organic farming means farming with natural materials, rather than with man-made fertilizers or pesticides . Organic farmers rely on many methods -- such as crop rotation   and the use of resistant varieties, because they are necessary for organic farmers to _ the shortage of man-made chemicals.\nOrganic farming is often supposed to be safer than traditional farming for the environment. Yet after a long research on organic farming worldwide for a number of years, science continues to be against this opinion. The House of Commons committee on agriculture stated that, even with complete research work, it would fail to find any scientific evidence to prove \"that any of claims made for organic farming is always true\".\nHowever, the talk about the benefits of organic farming is going on. This is partly because many people depend on their individual farm, the soil, the weather, and so on.\nQuestion:\nWhat can we know about organic farming?\nA. It refers to farming with natural materials, instead of chemical fertilizers.\nB. It refers to farming with chemical fertilizers rather than natural fertilizers.\nC. It refers to farming with soil rather than any other thing.\nD. It refers to growing crops with man-made fertilizers and pesticides.\nAnswer: A",

            "prompt": "Article:\nThroughout life,change is the only thing that seems constant.Change has come to my 1ife many ways,in myself,and in my surroundings.At the same time,some things stay the same.This is when traditions are formed.I am often reminded of this by the photograph that sits by my bed.\nIt all began with a kiss on my very first day of school.I remember dancing around the mirror,watching as my dark blue dress created a teacup around my waist.I admired the little ruffle of my shirt collar and how it matched perfectly with the trim at the bottom of my dress.I knew I would be the envy of all my classmates.\n    But somehow,something was missing.I reached under my bed for the large box of bows ,in every color1 imaginable,that I was famous for.I picked out a white one that would match my shirt and carefully ran to my mom.She fastened the finishing touch to my short brown hair and I was ready for my very first day of school.\n    After admiring myself in the mirror,I heard my mom yell,\"picture time!\" I dashed downstairs where my mum led to the spot.I  ly loved getting my picture taken.\nAfter several individual shots and some with my older sister,Katherine,my dad came for a picture with us together.As I climbed onto my dad's lap,he wrapped his arms around Katherine and me and we both leaned in to kiss him on the cheek.At that moment,mum snapped the shot and our tradition began.\nFrom them on,every year when the first day of school rolled around,we continued our tradition of pictures in the yard.The picture grew with my family;when my two younger sisters began school,our tradition expanded from 15 minutes to 45.The mass chaos was directed by my mom when my dad was already off to work or away on a business trip.\nQuestion:\nWhat's the author's purpose of writing such a passage?\nA. To prove change is the only thing that seems constant.\nB. To show what a skilled photographer her mother was.\nC. To recall a family tradition on their first day of school.\nD. To display her beautiful look on the first day of school.\nAnswer: D",

All she asked was \"Do you still want one of the kittens? There's one here with no eyes and no one can take him.\" Without thinking I told her that I did want the kitten.\nWhen we first brought him home Jack walked cautiously around, sniffing everything. He went through a time when he could climb the stairs, but couldn't get down. He would sit at the top and cry until someone came and got him. Every now and then when he gets disoriented he'll stop and cry. But we just call his name and talk to him and it isn't long before he finds his way back to us.\nAlso, a few weeks after getting Jack, we got a new barn cat named Bear. I always take Jack outside at that time for some fresh air and exercise. He loves to run (at top speed!) around the backyard and gardens. Bear and Jack have become best friends. Jack always knows when Bear is around. He'll run across the yard straight to Bear and wrap his front legs around his neck in a big hug. When they're tired they'll lie down in the grass together.\nJack is truly an inspiration. I've owned a lot of kittens in my life, but Jack is the happiest, most playful of them all.

            "testing input": "Article:\nThere has been much discussion recently about reducing the weight of English in China's high-stake tests such as the national college entrance examination. It is argued by some applauding the recent change to reduce the importance of English in tests so that it will lead students to focus more on learning Chinese. The TV program Writing in Chinese has exposed the problem that students and the general public cannot write in Chinese as they used to do.\nSome blame the design of the curriculum for giving English an equal or greater amount of emphasis, which might have contributed to the failure in teaching Chinese. But this is probably not a fair accusation since children in English speaking countries cannot spell either.\nI doubt that studying English in itself hurts the study of Chinese. In fact, high achievers in English or another foreign language are more likely to be high achievers in Chinese. It has been proved many times in recent Chinese history that those capable of using a foreign language are also masters in their mother tongue. Qian Zhongshu, Lu Xun and Lin Yutang are just a few examples.\nAnother trend of thought for curriculum reform is related to the perception of \"worth\". It is true that English is one of the subjects that students do spend too much time on, with pitiful results. This makes some doubt if it is worth giving it priority. But this is not a sound argument either as students still need to study things that matter more to their future in spite of challenges learning English presents to them.\nImprovements in Chinese language education should not be achieved by sacrificing another important subject. There should be a robust  foreign language education program, as a foreign language improves a student's future job prospects. Bashing  English education as a waste of time or using it as a goat for failures in Chinese education are both harmful tendencies.\nTo be constructive, we ought to start a dialogue on ways to make improvements in learning outcomes so that students' time learning English is spent more effectively. There are a few things that could improve English education, such as assessment design,learner motivation and teaching style,\nI am sure there are many other areas where changes can greatly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of English learning. The public discourse at present is a little oversimplified. People are arguing for or against English having less weight in major tests, when the dialogue should be taken a step further, to the improvement of learning or teaching methods that may benefit the teaching of other subjects as well, Chinese included.\nQuestion:\nAccording to the passage, which of the following statements is right?\nA. The TV program Writing in Chinese is very popular at present.\nB. Good results of learning English are not worth so much time.\nC. Some are in favor of attaching less importance to English in exams.\nD. Sacrificing English can improve Chinese language education.\nAnswer: A",

            "testing input": "Article:\nIt seems that men are under more stress when stuck in a traffic jam than women. British researchers for the GPS company TomTom used saliva  to decide the stress levels. Levels for women were far lower than levels for men. Most of the people taking part in the research, men and women, reported that they didn't feel any stress at all. Even with that report, their saliva told a different story. In fact, people are under stress while in traffic and not even realizing it. That does not mean good things for health. People can only do something about their health if they know something is wrong.\nMen are more likely to have much less patience than women. That is why their stress levels are much higher than women when they are sitting still in traffic. Men want to get where they are going now.\n72% of people taking part in the research drove every day. Of course, 86% believed that traffic affected their lives in a bad way. Being stuck in traffic after a stressful day at work could raise the level to an even higher level. The more likely they are to get further stressed.\nStress from being stuck in traffic is also related to a higher chance of getting into car accidents. It is wise to avoid driving when already feeling stressed. Calm down for a few minutes, take a deep breath and drive as safely as possible. Driving with too much stress could cost you or someone else their life. It is not worth the danger.

            "testing input": "Article:\nWhen American inventor Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, it was a revolution in communication. For the first time, people could talk to each other over great distances. Over the last two decades a new means of spoken communication has appeared: the mobile phone.\n The mobile phone is like a two-way radio. But the two-way radio is a limited means of communication. As soon as the users move out of range of each other's broadcast area, the signal is lost. In the 1940s, researchers experimented with the idea of using a number of radio masts   to pick up signals from two-way radios. A caller would always be within range of one of the masts. When he or she moved too far away from one mast, the next mast would pick up the signal. (Scientists referred to each mast's reception area as being a \"cell\". This is why in many countries mobile phones are called \"cellphones\".)\nHowever, 1940s' technology was just at the beginning. The \"mobile phones\" were huge boxes. They had to be moved by car.\nThe first real mobile telephone call was made in 1973 by Dr Martin Cooper. As soon as his invention was complete, he tested it by calling a rival   scientist to announce his success. Within a decade, mobile phones became available to the public.\nThey have changed the way we do a lot of things. One powerful feature is: the short message service (SMS) or text message. It's the perfect communication method for the busy modern lifestyle. The text message has changed the way we write in English. The language construction became more lax  . Traditional rules of grammar and spelling are much less important.\nOver the last few years mobiles have become more and more advanced.

            "testing input": "Article:\nOne of the best-known American writers of children's books is Alfred Strong, or Doctor Strong, as he is better known to readers everywhere. Now, an art show called \"Doctor Strong From Then to Now\" is travelling around the United States. The pictures and drawings show the history of Doctor Strong.\nDoctor Strong first became famous almost fifty years ago when his first children's book was published. Since then, he has written forty-five books that have sold more than one hundred million copies around the world.\nDoctor Strong's books are known for their easy use of words and colorful, hand-drawn pictures. These drawings bring life to his imaginary creatures. The Cat in the Hat, Horton the Elephant, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, and hundreds of others.\nThe San Diego Museum, in California, organized the art show. It included about three hundred Doctor Strong's original  drawings and some of his writings.\nMost of Doctor Strong's books, although written in a funny way, have serious messages. For example, in Mc Elligot's Pool, he describes the danger of pollution.
