            "prompt": "Article:\nAfter a quick breakfast, I went into the lecture  hall in a hurry. A famous teacher was speaking to the students. He was holding up a $100 bill. Then he said to over 300 students, \" Who would like this $100 bill?\" The students put up their hands at once. Then he said, \"I am going to give this $100 bill to one of you, but first, let me do this.\" He made the bill into a ball. Then he said, \"Who wants it now?\" The hands went back into the air. \"Well,\" he said, \"What if I do this?\" and he dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. He picked up the dirty bill and said, \"Who still wants it?\" Hands went back again into the air.\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"you have learned a valuable lesson today. No matter what I did to the $100 bill, you still want this bill. Many times in our life, we are dropped and stepped on. We feel as if we are worth nothing. But remember, no matter what has happened to you, you will never lose your value. You are always valuable to those people who love you. Your value doesn't come form what you do or whom you know, but who you are.\"\nQuestion:\nThe lesson tells us a truth, that is  _  .\nA. we should know what we do\nB. we should know whom we know\nC. we must know who we are\nD. how to use money\nAnswer: D",

When we arrived, we discovered that the family we were going to help was living in a trailer that was in poor condition, no bigger than two parking spaces. A group of people had been working on it for two weeks, but every time they finished one problem, another appeared.\nWe soon decided that the only way was to build a new house. It was something unusual because normally our goal was to repair old homes. The family was pleased with their new house that was 20 by 30 feet with three bedrooms, a bath and a kitchen.\nOn Tuesday of that week, I asked the family's three boys, Josh, Eric and Ryan, \"What do you want for your new room?\" Kids in the families we had helped usually wanted toys or posters, so we were surprised when Josh, the oldest boy said, \"We just want beds.\" The boys had never slept in a bed. That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\nOn Friday when we saw the truck coming, we told the family about the surprise. They were very excited.\nThat afternoon, while we were setting up the beds, Eric ran into the house to watch us with wide eyes. As Maggie, a member of our group, put one of the pillows on the bed, Eric asked, \"What is that?\"\n\"A pillow,\" she replied.\n\"What do you do with it?\" Eric went on asking.\n\"When you go to sleep, you put your head on it,\" Maggie answered softly. Tears came to our eyes as she handed Eric the pillow.\n\"Oh . . . that's soft,\" he said, holding it tightly.\nNow, when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems very urgent , my dad always asks, \"Do you have a pillow?\" We know exactly what he means.\nQuestion:\nWhy did the writer's group build a new house for the family?\nA.

Tears came to our eyes as she handed Eric the pillow.\n\"Oh . . . that's soft,\" he said, holding it tightly.\nNow, when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems very urgent , my dad always asks, \"Do you have a pillow?\" We know exactly what he means.\nQuestion:\nWhat can we learn from the story?\nA.

You don't need to care about those who have beautiful houses with large  gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and lots of money and so on. Why? .Because  those who have big house may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads at their free time.\nIn fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you  do something good to others, you will feel happy, too.All these are your happiness. If you notice them, you can see that happiness is always around you.\nHappiness is not the same as money.It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a _ door. When it closes, it also opens.
