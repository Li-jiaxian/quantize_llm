They hate my friends' looks and they keep complaining when I go with them. I'm not allowed to stay out as late as my friends do, so I can't have any fun. My parents only seem to care about my school grades. Although I love them, sometimes I feel we live in different worlds. If they love me, can't they understand me? How can I make them understand me?\nAngel\nDear Angel,\nYour problem is common to both teenagers and parents. Don't worry, because all this is natural. You see, your parents have grown up at a different time and they have different experiences. So, they think some things are strange, but you find the same things are all right. For example, the music you like may sound like noise to them. Your parents love you, so they feel they must stop you from doing whatever they find strange. On the other hand, you don't want to be different from other teenagers, so you feel that your parents\nyou.\nI think you should talk about this problem with your parents.

Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"\nQuestion:\nHow did Little Kids Rock help the school?\nA. By writing music for kids.\nB. By playing kids' favorite songs.\nC.

Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a fatal accident as a teenager driving alone. However, the possibility of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional (added) passenger.\nIt was also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased greatly after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight. With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late night accident.\nRobert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with \"really stupid behavior\" than with just a lack of driving experience. Both he and the author of the study believe that the way to help solve the problem is to have states setting up so-called graduated licensing systems . A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove that he/she is able to drive in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with a limited number of passengers, before graduating to full driving on his own. About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place. The systems have reduced teenage driver crashes , according to recent studies.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following situations is most dangerous according to the passage?\nA.

Indeed, a 16-year-old driver with three or more passengers is three times as likely to have a fatal accident as a teenager driving alone. However, the possibility of death for drivers between 30 and 59 decreases with each additional (added) passenger.\nIt was also found that the death rates for teenage drivers increased greatly after 10 p.m., and especially after midnight. With passengers in the car, the driver was even more likely to die in a late night accident.\nRobert Foss, a scientist at the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center, says the higher death rates for teenage drivers have less to do with \"really stupid behavior\" than with just a lack of driving experience. Both he and the author of the study believe that the way to help solve the problem is to have states setting up so-called graduated licensing systems . A graduated license requires that a teenager first prove that he/she is able to drive in the presence of an adult, followed by a period of driving with a limited number of passengers, before graduating to full driving on his own. About half of the states now have some sort of graduated licensing system in place. The systems have reduced teenage driver crashes , according to recent studies.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following situations is most dangerous according to the passage?\nA.

That is why several hundred children and grown-ups each have sent a little money to the zoo to help pay for Brocky's food. Some children sent in only a quarter because that was all the money they had. Other children sent in more money than that.\nSince so many people sent money to the zoo to help pay for Brocky's food, he now will be able to eat as much as he wants. Brocky surely must be a happy tiger to know that he has so many adopted parents. Many children must also be happy to know that they have helped to feed him. It really will be thrilling for those children to go to the Natural Zoo to visit their adopted tiger Brocky.\nQuestion:\nSeveral hundred people give money to the zoo to help Brocky because   _  .\nA. its food is too expensive for one person to afford\nB. people don't want to spend too much money on Brocky\nC. people don't love Brocky enough\nD. the zoo forces them to do so\nAnswer: D",

As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o`clock. This meal included cakes and sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important,  fine china cups and plates, and silver teapots, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular social occasions. Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in the modern Britain.\nWill you come for coffee?\nCoffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use the words \"Will you come for coffee?\" to mean \"Would you like to come to my home for a chat?\"Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a \"coffee\" party.\nCoffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange \nIn the 17thcentury London, coffeehouses were busy and noisy places.

I hope you can understand  it.\nI love studying in London and I have many new friends. Most of them are my classmates. From Monday to Friday, we have English, math, physics and P. E. in the morning. I like English and physics, because they're interesting. I don't like math. It's too boring. At noon, I have to have lunch at school because my home is far from my school. We usually have two classes in the afternoon--art and politics. We finish our classes at 3:30 p. m. After school, my friends and I always play football on the playground. And then we go home by bus.\nOn weekends, we have no classes. We often go to the park and sometimes we go to the movies in the evening. We see movies twice a month. I like some famous  actors like Jackie Chan.\nOh, I have no time to write more. Please write back soon.\nBest wishes,\nWang Gang\n,.\nQuestion:\nWang Gang and his friends go to the movies   _  .\nA. once a week\nB. once a month\nC. twice a week\nD. twice a month\nAnswer: D",
