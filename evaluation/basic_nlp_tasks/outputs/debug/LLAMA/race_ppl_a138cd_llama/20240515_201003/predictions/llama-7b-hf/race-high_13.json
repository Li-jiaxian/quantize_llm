Participants who took a nap were asked about their dreams before sleep and after sleep--and they were awakened within a minute of sleep to describe their dreams.\nStickgold, a neuroscientist ,wanted to know what people were dreaming about when their eyes weren't moving during sleep.\nFour of the 50 people who slept said their dreams were connected to the maze. Some dreamed about the music that had been playing when they were working ; others said they dreamed about seeing people in the maze. When these four people tried the computer maze again, they were able to find the tree faster than before their naps.\nStickgold suggests the dream itself doesn't  help a person learn--it's the other way around.He suspects that the dream was caused by the brain processes associated with learning.\nAll four of the people who dreamed about the task had done poorly the first time, which makes Stickgold wonder if the dreams show up when a person finds a new task particularly difficult. People who had other dreams, or people who didn't take a nap, didn't show the same improvement.\n\nQ: According to Stickgold,  _  .\n\nA. every person may dream about what they learned\nB. people's brain processes may still be connected with their learning in their dreams\nC. once people's eyes stop moving, they are sure to dream about something\nD. no matter how fantastical or boring, dreams are connected with people's life\nA: B",

Parents, teachers, even the kids themselves, scored the youngsters on measures like \"acting before thinking\" and \"Persistence in reaching goals.\"\nThe study led  by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1,000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\"The children who had the lowest self-control when they were age three to ten, later on had the most health problems in their 30s,\" Moffitt said,\"and they had the worst financial situation. They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a single parent on a very low income.\" Moffitt explained that self-control problems were widely observed, and weren't just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids.\nMoffitt said it's still unclear why some children have better self-control than others, though she said other researchers have found that it's mostly a learned behavior, with relatively little genetic influence. But good self-control can be set to run in families because children with good self-control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents. But the good news, Moffitt said, is that self-control can be taught by parents, and through school curricula that have been shown to be effective.\n\nQ: Which of the following might be the best title of the  passage?\n\nA.

He grew up having other kittens to play and socialize with, and was used to people from the moment he was born since there are always kids hanging around the barn. He was a favorite amongst the students at the barn. However, when it came time to find the kittens homes, no one knew where Jack would end up. That's when I got an e-mail from my friend. All she asked was \"Do you still want one of the kittens? There's one here with no eyes and no one can take him.\" Without thinking I told her that I did want the kitten.\nWhen we first brought him home Jack walked cautiously around, sniffing everything. He went through a time when he could climb the stairs, but couldn't get down. He would sit at the top and cry until someone came and got him. Every now and then when he gets disoriented he'll stop and cry. But we just call his name and talk to him and it isn't long before he finds his way back to us.\nAlso, a few weeks after getting Jack, we got a new barn cat named Bear. I always take Jack outside at that time for some fresh air and exercise. He loves to run (at top speed!) around the backyard and gardens. Bear and Jack have become best friends.

British researchers for the GPS company TomTom used saliva  to decide the stress levels. Levels for women were far lower than levels for men. Most of the people taking part in the research, men and women, reported that they didn't feel any stress at all. Even with that report, their saliva told a different story. In fact, people are under stress while in traffic and not even realizing it. That does not mean good things for health. People can only do something about their health if they know something is wrong.\nMen are more likely to have much less patience than women. That is why their stress levels are much higher than women when they are sitting still in traffic. Men want to get where they are going now.\n72% of people taking part in the research drove every day. Of course, 86% believed that traffic affected their lives in a bad way. Being stuck in traffic after a stressful day at work could raise the level to an even higher level. The more likely they are to get further stressed.\nStress from being stuck in traffic is also related to a higher chance of getting into car accidents. It is wise to avoid driving when already feeling stressed. Calm down for a few minutes, take a deep breath and drive as safely as possible. Driving with too much stress could cost you or someone else their life. It is not worth the danger. Reduce the amount of stress that you are experiencing before getting into the car and find ways to relax more when stuck in traffic. One way to relax is to have soothing music to play during these times.\n\nQ: What can we learn about the research?\n\nA. 14% of people taking part in it were not affected by traffic jams.\nB.

Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartments. Their rent cannot increase; therefore, they are not in danger of losing their homes. However, the critics say that after a long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits .

As soon as the users move out of range of each other's broadcast area, the signal is lost. In the 1940s, researchers experimented with the idea of using a number of radio masts   to pick up signals from two-way radios. A caller would always be within range of one of the masts. When he or she moved too far away from one mast, the next mast would pick up the signal. (Scientists referred to each mast's reception area as being a \"cell\".

They had to be moved by car.\nThe first real mobile telephone call was made in 1973 by Dr Martin Cooper. As soon as his invention was complete, he tested it by calling a rival   scientist to announce his success. Within a decade, mobile phones became available to the public.\nThey have changed the way we do a lot of things. One powerful feature is: the short message service (SMS) or text message.

For the first time, people could talk to each other over great distances. Over the last two decades a new means of spoken communication has appeared: the mobile phone.\n The mobile phone is like a two-way radio. But the two-way radio is a limited means of communication. As soon as the users move out of range of each other's broadcast area, the signal is lost. In the 1940s, researchers experimented with the idea of using a number of radio masts   to pick up signals from two-way radios. A caller would always be within range of one of the masts. When he or she moved too far away from one mast, the next mast would pick up the signal. (Scientists referred to each mast's reception area as being a \"cell\". This is why in many countries mobile phones are called \"cellphones\".)\nHowever, 1940s' technology was just at the beginning. The \"mobile phones\" were huge boxes. They had to be moved by car.\nThe first real mobile telephone call was made in 1973 by Dr Martin Cooper. As soon as his invention was complete, he tested it by calling a rival   scientist to announce his success. Within a decade, mobile phones became available to the public.\nThey have changed the way we do a lot of things. One powerful feature is: the short message service (SMS) or text message. It's the perfect communication method for the busy modern lifestyle. The text message has changed the way we write in English. The language construction became more lax  . Traditional rules of grammar and spelling are much less important.\nOver the last few years mobiles have become more and more advanced. We have seen the introduction of cameras, global positioning system and Internet access.\nAlexander Graham Bell would be surprised if he could see how far the science of the telephone has developed in less than 150 years.

Soon, it spread   to the second floor. There were some people on the second floor at that time. Their lives were in danger. A few people jumped out of the window. Luckily, they only got small injuries. Those who were still on the second floor were just crying for help.

That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt -- including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses   and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake that's the world's biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When rain starts to dissolve the hotel, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks.\nGreen Magic Nature Resort\nWhere: Vythiri, India\nHow much: About $240 a night\nWhy it's cool: Riding a pulley -operated lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure. As you look out of your open window -- there is no glass! -- you watch monkeys and birds in the rain forest canopy. Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don't even have to come down for breakfast -- the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn \"elevator\".\nDog Bark Park Inn B&B \nWhere: Cottonwood, Idaho\nHow much: $92 a night\nWhy it's cool: This doghouse isn't just for the family pet. Sweet Willy is a 30-foot-tall dog with guest rooms in his belly. Climb the wooden stairs beside his hind leg to enter the door in his side. You can relax in the main bedroom, go up a few steps to the loft in Willy's head, or hang out inside his nose. Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant outside.\nGamirasu Cave Hotel\nWhere: Ayvali, Turkey\nHow much: Between $130 and $475 a night.\nWhy it's cool: This is caveman cool! Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern. Bathrooms and electricity provide what you expect from a modern hotel, and the white volcanic ash, called tufa, keeps the rooms cool, about 65degFin summer.

That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt -- including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses   and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake that's the world's biggest salt flat.

Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year.\nPeople who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle.\nDanny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else... There is always the potential for finding a million dollars. Nothing beats it.\"\nIt's a place where dreams --- spiritual or material --- can be fulfilled; a place, for one last bet in life.\n\nQ: What is the author's purpose of giving Neil Schellnegger and Danny Hatcher as examples?\n\nA. To show the magic power of opal mining.\nB. To tell people it isn't always hard to mine opals.\nC. To warn people not to take up this kind of job.\nD. To persuade people to look for more resources for the country.\nA: D",

Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable  and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous--then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen.\n\nQ: What is the main purpose of this passage?\n\nA. To introduce the writer's sports experience.\nB. To advise on how to deal with nervousness.\nC. To help people remember their fears.\nD. To explain the dangers of nervousness.\nA: C",

There are some benefits of course, as people who are breaking laws can be watched and caught using cameras and this helps keep our society and public places safe. These cameras are everywhere and most are openly visible on roads, in airports, businesses, shopping centers and government buildings and even in lifts. Even schools have started using spy cams to watch student activity and behaviour.\nThe cameras are so common now that we hardly ever even notice them. But the problem lies with the ones that are hidden away from our eyes and are unseen. Technology has helped develop tiny cameras that can be very well hidden and they can \"spy\" on shoppers, workers, babysitters and people in hotels and clubs without the people even knowing.\nIt is these spy cams that people feel are an invasion of privacy. Recently, in the US, there have been a number of court cases against babysitters whose actions have been recorded by their employers on hidden cameras.\nThe number of cameras in public and private areas is on the increase and with rising crime rates and the recent terrorist attacks, more and more surveillance cameras are being used to watch us. This means that we all have to be aware that our employers, department stores, police and even some of our friends could be spying on us at any time!\n\nQ: In the writer's opinion, surveillance cameras   _  .         .\n\nA. do more good than wrong\nB. are overused\nC. should be very popular\nD. ought to be more widely used\nA: A",

She then took it a step further by pouring more water onto the film and turning it into a water ball, leaving the audience amazed by what they saw.\nThe 40-minute lesson seemed to have passed too quickly for students to see enough of those magical experiments. But sending stuff into space is really expensive. According to The Beijing Times, every kilogram launched into space cost 20,000 dollars. The experimental items taken this time were all strictly selected and weighed about 2.9 kilograms in total. This adds up to quite a large price tag.\nThe organizers of the event also had to consider the time of day: the communication signal between the earth and Tiangong-1 was best during that specific 40 minutes, when the spacecraft was flying within the coverage of all of the ground-based testing stations.\n\nQ: Why is the class different from a common one?\n\nA.

That is\nfor life in general.\nSet aside time specifically for each subject. Try to study one subject a day. You need to balance time. If you are bad at balancing things, make a personal timetable. Even if you do not stick to it, you will have an idea what you should be doing each day. This is better than trying to do everything each day and, at the end of the week, not achieve anything. Also, try to keep your weekends free of studying. Only study at the weekend if you really have to.\nI had to learn to balance work, study and family when I was at college. I was a retail assistant working part-time and had at least four modules to complete at the same time at college. I also had to help around the house doing household cleaning and shopping at times. I managed to finish my college work on time, which was very difficult and hard, and still hold down a job.\nWhy was it possible?

Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output. Fryer's conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam, aside from general rules like \"study harder.\" Reading certain books, on the other hand, is a well-set task over which they have much more control.\nAs long as you have direct control over your goal, you have a much higher chance of success.

Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output. Fryer's conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam, aside from general rules like \"study harder.\" Reading certain books, on the other hand, is a well-set task over which they have much more control.\nAs long as you have direct control over your goal, you have a much higher chance of success. And it's easier to start again if you fail, because you know exactly what you need to do.\nIf you want to cut down on your spending, a good goal would be making morning coffee at home instead of going to a cafe, for example. This is a well-specified action-based goal for which you can measure your success easily. Spending less money isn't a goal because it's too general.
