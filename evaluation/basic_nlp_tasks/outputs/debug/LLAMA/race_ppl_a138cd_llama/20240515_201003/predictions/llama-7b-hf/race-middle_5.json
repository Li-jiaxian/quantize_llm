Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister.\" My heart nearly stopped. I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy, \"What if we checked again, just in case  you do have enough money?\"\n\"Ok,\" he said. \"I hope that I have enough.\" I added some of my money to his without letting him see and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some spare money left . The little boy said, \"Thank you God for giving me enough money!\"\nI left the store, feeling as if my life had been changed forever.\n\nQ: What does the story tell us?\n\nA. We should help other people in need.\nB. Money does not matter.\nC. We should believe in Santa Claus.\nD. We should borrow money when necessary\nA: D",

Sunlight can help our bodies produce more dopamine, reported AFP.\nAccording to the study, primary school students in Singapore spend only 30 minutes outdoors every day; in Australia, by contrast, kids spend about three hours a day outside. As a result, fewer children in Australia are nearsighted-only 10 percent, compared with 90 percent in Singapore.\n\"Children in East Asia basically go to school... go home and stay inside. They study and they watch television,\" Ian Morgan of the Australian National University told AFP.\nBut being a bookworm or a couch potato does not directly harm the eyes, added Morgan. \"As long as they get outside, it doesn't seem to matter how much study they do,\" he explained. \"There are some kids who study hard and get outside and play hard and they are generally fine. The ones who are at major risk are the ones who study hard and don't get outside. As a result of massive   educational pressures and the construction   of a child's day, the amount of time they spend outside in bright light is minimized.\"\nExperts suggest children should stay outside for two to three hours every day.

That number is part of the system used by libraries to organize their collections of books. And it's used in many countries. The number on each book tells you exactly what kind of book it is. This system is also useful for knowing where to go in the library to find a book.\nIn this system, there are ten large groups of books. Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book. A book on the history of South Africa will have the number 968.\nAs you can see, it is a simple system to use as long as you understand what the numbers mean. With this system, the library can keep its books well organized, and people can easily find the book that they want.\n\nQ: The reading is about  _  .\n\nA. libraries\nB. working in a library\nC. how numbers are organized\nD. how books are organized in libraries\nA: A",

This system is also useful for knowing where to go in the library to find a book.\nIn this system, there are ten large groups of books. Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book.

When he arrived at his seat in the classroom that morning, he found an invitation on his desk. It was from several of his classmates asking him to join them on a camping trip.

She spent every night lying in our bed-snoring  so loudly that I hardly got a good night's sleep.\nThen, about six months after she arrived, I felt that something in my heart was taking place, and I was unable to stop it. My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter. The point is that I was changing.\nMy wife and I both agree that it is Gertie who has changed my behaviour. Gertie is now nearly two years old and almost fully grown.I have come to like the pet little by little, though she is my wife's dog.\n\nQ: What can we learn from this passage?\n\nA. The dog has been trained very well.\nB. The man has become more confident.\nC. The man has become more friendly.\nD. The man likes the dog better than his wife.\nA: C",

Now for a middle school student, there was nothing basic at all about it. So I had studied for about two hours the night before. After reviewing it for some time, I had started to understand it, so then I closed the book and  _ . However, it was not until midnight that I fell asleep. The next day, when I got the test, it might as well have been written in Serbian (which I don't know how to read). I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange. I sat back on my chair and looked for any possible answers, but I could not remember anything or think correctly. I started thinking about my dad coming home from work to find that I failed the test ...\n\"How could you have failed the test? I am certain that nobody else in the whole class got as bad a grade as you did!\"\nNaturally I didn't want that to happen. My dad was also really busy at work at present, so I was afraid that this might make him mad. When feeling hopeless, I noticed that my table partner was writing fast on his test. I could see smoke rising up from how fast he was writing. I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind.

Now for a middle school student, there was nothing basic at all about it. So I had studied for about two hours the night before. After reviewing it for some time, I had started to understand it, so then I closed the book and  _ . However, it was not until midnight that I fell asleep. The next day, when I got the test, it might as well have been written in Serbian (which I don't know how to read). I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange. I sat back on my chair and looked for any possible answers, but I could not remember anything or think correctly. I started thinking about my dad coming home from work to find that I failed the test ...\n\"How could you have failed the test? I am certain that nobody else in the whole class got as bad a grade as you did!\"\nNaturally I didn't want that to happen. My dad was also really busy at work at present, so I was afraid that this might make him mad. When feeling hopeless, I noticed that my table partner was writing fast on his test. I could see smoke rising up from how fast he was writing. I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind. I reasoned that if I started cheating now, it would be hard to give up that habit during high school. In the end, I decided not to copy his answers, and got a B- on that test.
