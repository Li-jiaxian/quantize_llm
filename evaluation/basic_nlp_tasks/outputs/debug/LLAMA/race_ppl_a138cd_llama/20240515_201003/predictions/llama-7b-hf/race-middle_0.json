My aunt went to California, but my uncle decided to get her back. There was one matter: where to put his young daughter. Luckily, my mother loved Marley, giving her more attention than her family ever did.\nOn that Christmas Eve, my cousin arrived on our doorstep carrying an old blue suitcase. Before she stepped inside, Marley said, \"It doesn't matter. When my parents come back, we'll have a bigger Christmas than this.\"\nLate on the night Marley arrived, my mom came into my room, her arms filled with packages.I knew they were my Christmas presents. \"I know how you love surprises but we have to decide which ones to give to Marley.\"\nMy mother carefully opened the gifts. Wow! I saw ice skates, red leather gloves and a dollhouse. The last present was the music box we'd asked the lady at the local store to take down and play for us over and over again.\n\"Which ones?\" my mother asked. \"She can have the ice skates,\" I said reluctantly . \"That's good,\" my mother said. She began to tape the packages up again. Then she stopped and asked, \"Are you sure about these?\" At that moment, I realized she expected more from me than I had already given. So I gave her the music box, too, and  _ . The next morning, Marley's eyes were resolute . She expected nothing and wanted us to know she didn't care. But when she saw her name on the biggest box, she couldn't hide her excitement. I thought my happiness would be cut in half. Instead it was doubled.\nOver the last 40 years, Marley and I have grown apart . But the love we felt for each other that day still remains. Today Marley says, \"They were the best presents I ever got.\n\nQ: According to this passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?\n\nA. The writer's parents got a divorce when she was ten.\nB. The writer hated her cousin because she took away some of her presents\nC. Marley expected nothing, so she wasn't excited about the Christmas presents.\nD.

Penguins cannot fly,but they are fine swimmers. Penguins eat fish and krill .\nThe warming of the earth is the decrease in penguin populations. The heating of the air has caused ocean waters to become warmer. Higher water temperatures have reduced the supply of fish and krill.
