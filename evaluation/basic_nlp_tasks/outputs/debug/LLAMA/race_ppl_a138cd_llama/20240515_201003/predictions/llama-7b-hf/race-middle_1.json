But now theold also take part in this activity.\nIt is now possible to exchange \"red envelopes\" with smartphone, which is popular in China and has caused a battle  for the _ market between the two companies providing the service, Tencent and Alibaba.\n\"You don't have to pay the same cost or wait as long as you would for a traditional bank transfer . It's more convenient, simple and fun,\" Wang Le, a 28-year-old Beijinger, told AFP. \" With electronic red envelopes, you're not limited by your identity  or the time of year. It's a new, fresh way of playing the game.\"\nThe idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat, a mobile messaging system with over 400 million users and run[:**]by Tencent, China's largest Internet service system. It was successful at once.\nThis year, Alipay Wallet , the payment system run by Alibaba, is ready to take on the competition. It is allowing its 190 million users to send digital gifts, especially on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo.\nFor the past few weeks a digital battle has been terrible, with Tencent banning  Alipay from sending red envelopes on WeChat, saying they were at a risk.

High tech is just a shorter way of saying high technology. And high technology describes any invention or system that uses the newest ideas or discoveries of science and engineering.\nWhat is high tech? A computer is high tech. So is a communications satellite. A modern manufacturing     system is surely high tech.\nHigh tech became a popular expression in the United States during the early 1980's. Because of improvements in technology, people could buy many new kinds of products in American stores, such as home computers, microwave ovens  , etc. \"State of the art\" is something that is as modern as possible. It is a product that is based on the very latest ways and technology. Something that is \"state of the art\" is the newest possible design or product of a business or industry. A state of the art television set, for example, uses the most modern electronic design and parts. It is the best that one can buy.\n\"State of the art\" is not a new expression. Engineers have used it for years, to describe the best and most modern way of doing something.\nMillions of Americans began to use the expression in the late 1970's. The reason was the computer revolution . Every computer company claimed   that its computers were \"state of the art\".\nComputer technology changes so fast that a state of the art computer today might be old tomorrow. The expression \"state of the art\" has become as common and popular as computers themselves. Now all kinds of products are said to be \"state of the art\".\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the passage?\n\nA. To tell how \"high tech\" and \"state of the art\" have developed.\nB.

            "prompt": "Read the article, and answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\n\nArticle:\n\"High tech\" and \"state of the art\" are two expressions that describe very modern technology. High tech is just a shorter way of saying high technology. And high technology describes any invention or system that uses the newest ideas or discoveries of science and engineering.\nWhat is high tech? A computer is high tech. So is a communications satellite. A modern manufacturing     system is surely high tech.\nHigh tech became a popular expression in the United States during the early 1980's. Because of improvements in technology, people could buy many new kinds of products in American stores, such as home computers, microwave ovens  , etc. \"State of the art\" is something that is as modern as possible. It is a product that is based on the very latest ways and technology. Something that is \"state of the art\" is the newest possible design or product of a business or industry. A state of the art television set, for example, uses the most modern electronic design and parts. It is the best that one can buy.\n\"State of the art\" is not a new expression. Engineers have used it for years, to describe the best and most modern way of doing something.\nMillions of Americans began to use the expression in the late 1970's. The reason was the computer revolution . Every computer company claimed   that its computers were \"state of the art\".\nComputer technology changes so fast that a state of the art computer today might be old tomorrow. The expression \"state of the art\" has become as common and popular as computers themselves. Now all kinds of products are said to be \"state of the art\".\n\nQ: The best title for the passage is  _  .\n\nA. Computer Technology\nB. High Tech and State of the Art\nC. Most Advanced Technology\nD. Two New Expressions\nA: D",

One cow can create 30 gallons of wastes each day. Now imagine the output of over 1,000 cows at Blue Farm. That's really a big amount.\nWhen farmers clean their barns, they put the wastes in a big heap, and spread some of them on their fields for fertilizer . But now places like Blue Spruce Farm have a new way of using cow wastes. They use them to produce electricity.\nHere's how it works: A big machine moves back and forth cleaning the barn floor. \"The cows aren't bothered,\" says Marie Audet. \"They are animals of habit; they get used to it, and just lift one foot and then another to let it go by.\"\nThe machine pushes the manure into a big 600-gallon tank like a small swimming pool. The tank is called a digester   because what happens there is just like what happens inside a cow: Bacteria  get to work and continue to digest the manure.\nMethane gas (, )in the atmosphere is known as a \"greenhouse\" gas because it keeps heat just like a greenhouse does, causing our planet to warm up. That's an environmental concern. But the digester has a good result. Its gas is kept and used to power electric generators  .\nAt Blue Farm, the generators make enough electricity to power 400 homes. The Audet family sells the extra electricity they can't use themselves.\n\nQ: What is the main purpose for writing the passage?\n\nA. To introduce a new way of making electricity\nB. To explain how a new energy works better\nC. To show a new rebuilding plan for a big farm\nD. To explain the reasons for green house effect\nA: D",

This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone.
