Most people start by buying themselves things, such as a new car or a bigger TV.\nMany people who win lots of money may suddenly find that they have a lot of socalled friends. The new friends they make may follow them for their money but they may also leave them when all the money is spent. Besides that, they can't decide what to do with the money, so they try to think what they want. In the end, most people usually decide to save the money.\nThere are some lottery winners who decide to quit their jobs, because they think they have enough money and don't need to work any longer.

That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\nOn Friday when we saw the truck coming, we told the family about the surprise.

Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit  ?\nIf you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant. The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk   said it was like a snake. The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear(  ) as he touched the animal's tusk. The fourth, who took hold of the elephant's tail, insisted that it was like a rope. The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arms around one of the elephant's legs. The last, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan.\nEach man's idea of the animal came from his own experience. So if someone disagrees with you about a \"simple fact\", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours.\nTo see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a \"simple fact\", try this simple experiment. Get three large bowls. Put ice water in one. Put hot water in the second. Put lukewarm water  in the third. Now put your left hand in the hot water. Put your right hand in the lukewarm water. Your right hand will tell you the water is cold. Your left hand will tell you it is hot.\n\nQ: It can be inferred from the passage that we should  _  .\n\nA. learn from the blind men\nB. not agree about simple facts\nC. never think about simple facts\nD. never decide anything with one side\nA: D",

Suddenly, I saw a little boy holding a lovely doll. He kept touching her hair. I watched him turn to a woman and say, \"Are you sure I don't have enough money?\" She said yes and told the boy not to go anywhere before she came back. Then she left.\nThe boy continued to hold the doll. I asked the boy who the doll was for. He said, \"It's the doll that my sister wanted so badly for Christmas. She just knew that Santa would bring it.\" I told him that Santa was going to bring it. He said, \"No, Santa can't go where my sister is. I have to give the doll to my mom to take it to her.\"\nI asked him where his sister was. He looked at me sadly and said, \"She's gone to heaven. My daddy said that Mom was going to be there with her.\" My heart nearly stopped beating. Then the boy said, \"I told my daddy to tell her not to go there until I got back.\" He took out some pictures of him and said, \"I want my mom to take these with her so she'll never forget me. I love my mom so much that I wish she didn't have to leave me, but Daddy said that she needed to be with my sister.\"\nThe boy lowered his head. While he was not looking, I reached into my purse and asked him, \"Shall we count that money again?\" He grew excited and said, \"Yes, I just know it has to be enough.\" So I put my money with his and we began to count it.

The 14-year-old boy from Xiamen used to get marks of over 110 points (out of 120 possible points) on his math tests. But during last semester's final exams, his math score was only 90 points.\nIt was a shock. \"I didn't know what happened,\" said Lin, who kept feeling nervous and frustrated about math during the following month.\nLike Lin, many of us have setbacks   in life. What would you do to deal with these setbacks? Would you just let them be and give up?\nLin chose to face his problem. His parents and teacher also gave him help. After some hard work he now gets marks between 100 and110 points on his math tests. Although he still isn't at his original   level, Lin doesn't panic anymore.\n\"Don't be scared by setbacks,\" he said. \"You will beat it.\"\nChen Xingzhu in Shenzhen also has a story to tell. The 15-year-old girl is not good at doing sit-ups  , which is necessary for the coming high school PE entrance exam. One has to do at least 35 sit-ups in a minute to pass the test. Most of Chen's classmates can do 40. However, Chen could only do 20.\nFeeling worried, Chen decided to do something. She did sit-ups for half an hour every day after school. Now, after a month, she can do 30 sit-ups a minute.\n\"I finally found what made me slow through continuous practice and then improved little by little,\" said Chen. \"I believe next month I will be able to do 40!\"\n\nQ: What problems does Chen Xingzhu have according to the passage?\n\nA.
