The mother's heartbeat also helps control the baby's breathing rate.\nEvery year, seven thousand babies are born at the health center where Ousmane Ndiaye works in Guediaway, outside Dakar. One in five is underweight. But Senegal has few incubators  in which to keep premature babies warm. In Africa, one newborn in twenty dies. A major reason is prematurity, so the death rates are among the highest in the world.\nDoctor Ndiaye says babies who weigh less than two kilos get special attention from _ who assist with the births. They teach the mother how to keep the baby wrapped to her chest. The health center has a Kangaroo Clinic, a special area for teaching this method.\nDoctor Ndiaye says they plan to expand the program throughout Senegal. But he believes the best way to get more people to use the kangaroo method is for mothers who have used the method to tell others about it.\n\nQ: What is the passage mainly about ?\n\nA. advantages of kangaroo mother care\nB. new ways to take care of newborn babies\nC. medical conditions in Senegal need improving\nD. saving premature babies with an idea from nature",
