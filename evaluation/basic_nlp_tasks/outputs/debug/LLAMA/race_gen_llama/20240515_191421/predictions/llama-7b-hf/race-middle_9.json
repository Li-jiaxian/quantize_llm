These two kinds of sports are team sports and individual   sports. Team sports are such sports as baseball, basketball, and volleyball. Team sports need two separate   teams. The teams play against each other. They compete against each other to get the best score. For example, in a football game, if team A gets 8 points and team B gets 4 points, team A wins the game. Team sports are sometimes called competitive   sports.\nAnother kind of sports is individual sports. In individual sports there are no teams. There isn't any competition. People play individual sports in order to get some exercise, not to win a game. Individual sports are such sports as swimming, skiing, and running.\nOf course, it is possible   to compete in individual sports. It is possible to keep a score in individual sports. The main difference, however, between team sports and individual sports is that individual sports can be finished alone. But team sports always need more than one person.\n,.\n\nQ: Team sports   _   .\n\nA. are also called individual sports\nB. can be done alone\nC. need two teams to play against each other\nD. are the same as individual sports",

It is your chance to do anything, except housework. Better still, have someone else do housework for a day. Housework is a daily and endless job and most people think it's boring to do housework. I have many friends and their wish is to stay away from housework. In fact, their wish can never come true.\nDo you know how to celebrate No Housework Day? Well , there are two different ways.\nIf you usually do the housework around the house, forget it on this day. Instead, kick back and enjoy the day. Relax and do anything, except housework.\nIf you never do housework, you can do it for your family. It gives your parents a break from the housework. And, you just might get a chance to know how much housework your parents need to do every day.\n\nQ: What's the main idea of the passage?\n\nA. It's about the daily housework.\nB. It's about our duty and right.\nC. It's about No Housework Day.\nD. It's about some national holiday.",
