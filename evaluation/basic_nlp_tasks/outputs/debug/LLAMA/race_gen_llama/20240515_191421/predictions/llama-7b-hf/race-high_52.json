Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor, were invited to Gates' $100 million lakeside house on Lake Washington for a dinner. \nChina has recently begun requiring Chinese computer makers to load legal software on their machines. \nIn Seattle's Chinatown, many stores hung Chinese and U.S.flags to welcome Hu, and many in the crowd outside the stately Fairmont Hotel on Monday night where Hu was staying were there to support the Chinese president.\n\nQ: What is the best title for the passage?\n\nA.

One of these dangers is from cyber-bullying. Cyber-bullying   is repeatedly hurting someone else through the use of technology. It consists of sending or posting cruel messages, photos, or videos on the Internet or other electronic media with the intent of damaging the reputation of the target. Imagine being a 13-year-old girl discovering a cell phone picture of her changing clothes for gym class has been sent to all her classmates. Or imagine being an 11-year-old boy who is scared to go to school because an unknown bully sent him an instant message saying that he is so fat that he should kill himself. Cases such as these are happening every day, leading kids to be depressed and unable to concentrate.\nWorse yet, parents are oblivious   to what is happening. Only 15 percent of parents even know what cyber-bullying is. And anyone who thinks that their child is not a victim or a bully is probably wrong. 90 percent of middle school students have had their feelings hurt online and 75 percent have admitted to visiting a website attacking another student.\nUnlike traditional schoolyard bullying, where a bully has a name and a face, cyber-bullying gets much of its power from anonymity  . A cyber bully might design a website posting cruel remarks about a classmate and never tell anyone that he or she was the creator. The cyber-bullying also gets its power from the scope   of its audience.

The dog was beautiful but was given up by its owners, as they did not want to take on the responsibility.\nLucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years.\nChester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the $15,000 cost of the animal.\nNot terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed  in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, \"She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure  or if his oxygen levels drop really low. She has saved him several times.\"\nCompanion animals are beautiful things and they establish a bond that can't be described without experiences. I know that I held my adopted dog a little closer after hearing this story. There are a lot of dogs out there that need good homes and that won't be as lucky as Juno. So, if you think you're prepared, you should consider giving one a nice home.\n\nQ: Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?\n\nA. Unlucky boy, lucky dog\nB. A love for a dog, a companion for a boy\nC. A faithful friend--Juno\nD. Love me, love my dog",

His thin hair had been carefully combed. He said good morning to us every day and we gradually began to nod and talk to each other.\nOne morning he even had a bunch of wild flowers in his hand. The driver turned around smiling and asked: \"Have you got yourself a girlfriend, Charlie?\" We never got to know if his name really was \"Charlie\", but he nodded shyly and said yes. The other passengers whistled and clapped at him. Charlie waved the flowers before he sat down on his seat.\nEvery morning after that Charlie always brought flowers. Some passengers also brought flowers for him. The bus became a happy place.\nThen, one morning, as autumn was closing in, Charlie wasn't waiting at his usual stop. When he wasn't there the next day and the day after that, we started wondering if he was sick or--hopefully - on holiday somewhere.\nWhen we came nearer to the center for senior citizens, one of the passengers asked the driver to wait. We all held our breaths when he went to the door.\nThe old gentle man was fine, but one of his close friends had died over the weekend. How silent we were the rest of the way to work.\nThe next Monday Charlie was waiting at the stop, stooping   a bit more, a little bit more gray, and without a tie. Inside the bus was silent. Even though no one had talked about it, all of us sat there silently, our eyes filled with tears and a bunch of wild flowers in our hands.\n\nQ: Which would be the best title for the passage?\n\nA. How to Shorten the Distance between People\nB. Smiles Make a Bus Feel Like Home\nC. Charlie, A Smiling Gentle Man\nD. The Key to Friendship -- Communication",
