So what do you expect him to say? He'll probably say, \"Fine, I'm all right, \" but you've put a bug in his ear--maybe now he's not sure. If you are a good friend, you may have seen something in his face, or his walk, that he overlooked  that morning. It starts him worrying a little. First thing you know, he looks in a mirror to see if everything is all right, while you go merrily on your way asking someone else. \"How do you feel?\"\n  Every question has its time and place. It's perfectly acceptable, for example, to ask \"How do you feel?\" if you're visiting a close friend in hospital. But if the fellow is walking on both legs, hurrying take a train, or sitting at his desk working, it's no time to ask him that silly question. \n  When George Bernard Shaw, the famous writer of plays, was in his eighties, someone asked him, \"How do you feel?\" Shaw put him in his place. \"When you reach my age, \" he said, \"either you feel all right or you're dead. \"\n\nQ: George Bernard's reply in the passages shows his  _  .\n\nA. cheerfulness\nB. cleverness\nC. kindness\nD. politeness",

Worried shoppers rushed to stores and supermarkets in the country for salt, with the belief that it might protect them from potential nuclear radiation spreading from Japan.\n    Many rushed to buy to store as much iodized salt as possible because of the rumor that iodized salt could help prevent radiation poisoning spreading from Japan' s Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Consumers also worried that the nuclear plumes might spread  to China by air and sea, polluting food sources, including salt taken from the sea.\n The wave of panic buying spread quickly across the country, driving up salt prices by five to ten fold in some cities.\n Even regions rich in salt production, like Jiangxi Province,faced sudden shortages.\nThe government took measures to guarantee enough supply and to stabilize the market. It also dismissed the nuclear rumors, saying the nuclear fallout was unlikely to reach the country, and that salt did not help to prevent radiation poisoning.\n    Local authorities have stepped in to stabilize the market, too. As well, state-owned salt companies have been urged to increase their supply.\n Facing expanding market demand, distribution centers have taken extra measures to ensure they are well-prepared.\nWang Yun, the General Manager of Beijing Salt Industry Corporation, said, \"Our storage reserves can guarantee a two-month supply for the Beijing market.\"\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the writer to give the example of Beijing Salt Industry Corporation?\n\nA.
