Therefore, they spend all day studying without time to relax.\nHowever, not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard. Students are pressurized by parents and teachers who are just concerned about their studies and exam scores while ignoring their hobbies and individual differences. As a result, students are forces to work harder and harder. Furthermore, there is pressure coming from students themselves. They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce. So, they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day. If they keep it up,   they'll suffer illnesses; both psychological and physical.\nWhat students need is relaxation. This doesn't mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard. It means \"work while you work, play while you play\". If you can do this, you will improve your health greatly. You'll feel yourself suddenly fresh, just like recovering from a terrible illness. You'll find that your studies are not a burden  anymore.\n\nQ: What is the passage mainly about?\n\nA. What to do to relax yourself.\nB. The serous situation for the poor students.\nC.

To make the most of this advantage, India's children need to be educated. On paper, India is doing well here. The country has a nationwide network of state primary schools funded by a specially designed tax. 96% of children aged 6-14 go to school, even in rural areas. That's well above the average for the developing world and their attendance is good. But the attainment is poor: three quarters of third graders can't read a gradeone text and 53% of grade five kids can't read at the standard they should have achieved at grade two. Levels of achievement are almost as bad in math. \n\"The main problem in India is not school entry or whether there is a local school; it's the delivery of education, the way teaching is done or not done,\" says Vinati Sukhdev, the executive director of Pratham, a charity that campaigns for better education in India. And according to Ms. Sukhdev, the country's teachers are the thirdbestpaid in the world but they're poorly trained and are often absent. Teacher attendance at the primary level is only 85%, according to Pratham's research and there's little punishment for those who don't turn up. \nThe government knows that state schooling needs to improve. In 2009 it passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), a law for the national provision of free, childfriendly education. It says that there should be two teachers for every 60 students and that they should go to work regularly, get there on time, follow the curriculum, assess how well the children are learning and meet regularly with parents. \n\"What we need to do next is improve accountability ,\" says Ms. Sukhdev. Schools have management committees that are supposed to include parent and local government representatives. \"But they don't work or people don't know they exist.\" Pratham tries to help local communities and parents drive improvement. \"You should see the kind of reaction we get when they realize the teacher is paid but isn't turning up!\"says Ms.  Sukhdev. \"We can't be everywhere, so we limit ourselves to working in a few districts, where we can create model schools. Then we try to work together with local government to make sure every school in the district or state is raised to that level.\"\nThe Read India programme is an example of what targeted help can achieve. Pratham has created an easytouse teaching and assessment pack called Learn to Read. It has trained teachers in how to use the pack at school and showed community health workers, volunteers and parents how it could support learning outside school. The programme has now run across 19 states, involving 450,000 volunteers and training 600,000 teachers and government workers. Among the 33 million children who have participated, the number of those who can read simple sentences has risen by 20%.\n\nQ: Who are to blame for India's poor education according to Vinati Sukhdev?\n\nA.

In fact, it's old news.\nIn the 1950s, Harry Harlow conducted a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed, without doubt, that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey.\nHarlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey \"mother\" topped with a plastic face. In this wire he fixed Mom with a milk bottle. The cage also held another wire mother covered with terry cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother to feed, demonstrating that a soft touch beat something to eat any day.\nHarlow's monkey work was important because, at the time, child care \"experts\" and everybody's grandmother had a \"no touch, no comfort\" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies, felt babies should sleep alone to grow up independent, and for God's sake put those kids down. But Harlow's work changed all that. Mothers were soon permitted to have their newborns next to them in the hospital.\nThe current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother love not only makes for a psychologically well-adjusted child, but also makes for a smart kid. Bard and her colleagues evaluated the abilities of the chimps when they were 12 months old with standard human tests for children of that age, tests that ask little kids to imitate some action.\nThe highly raised chimps did better than the ones that were not loved, and what do you know, the well-raised chimps did even better than human kids on this small IQ test.\nSo we hear it once again. We are primates, social animals which need care and love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time.
