A car approached from the opposite direction at about the same speed . As we passed each other , I caught the other driver's eye for only a second . I wondered whether he might be thinking , as I was , how dependent we were on each other at that moment . I was relying on him not to fall asleep , not to be put off by a phone conversation, not to cross over into my lane and bring my life to a sudden end . Though we had never spoken a word to each other , he relied on me in just the same way .\nMultiplied a million times over, I believe that is the way the world works . At some level , we all depend upon one another . Sometimes that dependence requires us simply not to do something like crossing over the double yellow line . And sometimes it requires us to act cooperatively , with friends or even with strangers .\nAs technology shrinks our world , the need increases for cooperative action among nations . In 2003, doctors in five nations were quickly organized to identify the SARS virus , which saved thousands of lives . The threat of international terrorism has shown itself to be a similar problem, one requiring coordinated action by police and intelligence forces across the world . We must recognize that our fates   are not ours alone to control .\nIn my own life , I've put great stock in personal responsibility .

He fled to Ethiopia, then to Kenya staying in a refugee camp for eight years, where he learned to play chess.\nJuac described a dangerous journey in which half the boys didn't survive. To eat, they had to kill wild animals.\n\"There were animals on the way. It was about a thousand miles and sometimes there was no water. When we were in Ethiopia, we had to cross the river and there a lot drowned.\"\nJuac arrived in the United States in 2004 and began working as a security guard. Winning a chess tournament gave him this teaching opportunity. Juac believes chess helps prepare young people for life.\n\"Some kids are not interested, so it's your job to make them like the game, to explain them what chess is going to help them with.\" He said. \"Like, I can tell, this game will give you patience, and help with your math skills.\"\nJulie Cathone, a second grade teacher in Jackson Public School, agrees. The School's principal, Meghan Kelley, said Juac and chess have made a big difference.\n\"What a role model. I mean when you think about just overcoming, and finding what you love and turning that into your life's work.\"\nJuac said he enjoys the freedom he has in the United States.

His job is to share his expertise  with students in schools, chess camps and other events.\nDuring Sudan's civil war in the mid-1980s, Juac was forced out of the country with 20,000 0ther so -called Lost Boys. He fled to Ethiopia, then to Kenya staying in a refugee camp for eight years, where he learned to play chess.\nJuac described a dangerous journey in which half the boys didn't survive. To eat, they had to kill wild animals.\n\"There were animals on the way. It was about a thousand miles and sometimes there was no water. When we were in Ethiopia, we had to cross the river and there a lot drowned.\"\nJuac arrived in the United States in 2004 and began working as a security guard. Winning a chess tournament gave him this teaching opportunity. Juac believes chess helps prepare young people for life.\n\"Some kids are not interested, so it's your job to make them like the game, to explain them what chess is going to help them with.\" He said. \"Like, I can tell, this game will give you patience, and help with your math skills.\"\nJulie Cathone, a second grade teacher in Jackson Public School, agrees.

What do you love to do? If you truly love what you do just go ahead and try to make a living by doing it. People will throw money at you to do it. But you will always have to work hard at it. I have to draw every single day of my life. I have to draw about 20 ideas. My advice is to put aside a certain amount of time every day and make you draw or whatever, especially when you don't feel like it. Only in this way will you be able to perfect your talent.\nThe first step you take is to go to your local library and ask for the publications issued in the current years. When you get these publications, try to find the names of the top people concerned and their presidents. After you find these, write down their names and addresses. Keep this list and update it every year. Next thing you want to do is to create at least 40 cartoons. Get a grid  from one of the strips in the newspapers, enlarge it to whatever size you wish and draw inside this grid. Now take the best 20 of your ideas and make them into finished pieces. To do this, you would want to copy them in ink because if you were a professional cartoonist, that was what you should do. Now you can reduce the size of the finished cartoons to fit onto a regular comic's page. By comparing yours with the others already in print, it gives you a good idea of clarity to your cartoon.\nThe next step is to write letters to presidents of the publication. In the letters, explain who you think would read your work, or in other words, what group do you think you would target. After you complete these, send all of your information enclosed with letters in the appropriate envelope.\nNow as soon as you send out these letters, start to create a brand new strip with all new characters. Don't _ because if your idea gets turned down then you will give up. And always remember. If you receive a rejection from any of them, keep in mind that you are working on something better. You will be working on something new and more exciting and the rejection letter will not have any impact. With this in mind...\n\nQ: The purpose of writing a letter to the president was to   _  .\n\nA. get some money to support the later career\nB. enclose the information on how to become cartoonists with the letter\nC. focus his attention on the work\nD. explain who would be the readers of the work",

Up to 70 percent of the world's coffee supply could be threatened over the next 66 years, according to a new study by researchers at England's Royal Botanic Gardens.\nNearly 100 percent of the world's Arabica coffee growing regions could become unsuitable for the plant by 2080, according to the study. Beans from Arabica coffee plants account for about 70 percent of the world's coffee, but the plant also has to be grown under strict weather conditions: they grow well at temperatures between 64 and 70 degrees Celsius, and are highly influenced by frost or temperatures higher than 73 degrees Celsius.\nWith temperatures estimated to increase by between 1.8 and 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the fragile plant might become increasingly expensive and difficult to grow, especially in places such as Ethiopia and Kenya. In that worst case, nearly all of the world's native Arabica coffee would die out. Under more conservative estimates, about 65 percent of the regions used to grow the coffee would become unsuitable for it The evidence from coffee farmers and coffee growing regions around the world is that they are already suffering from the influences of increased warming.\nSome farmers would likely be able to move their operations to other areas or would be able to overcome climate change with artificial cooling techniques, but wild Arabica is generally considered to be much more suitable for making high-quality coffee.\nIf Arabica becomes impossible to raise in its native areas, it could do serious damage to the economies of the mainly third-world countries in which it grows. Coffee is the world's most popular drink and is the second most-traded product in the world, behind oil.\n\nQ: What does the passage mainly talk about?\n\nA. Climate change affects people in many ways.\nB. More and more attention has been paid to climate change.\nC. The world's coffee supply could be threatened by climate change.\nD. The' growing conditions of Arabica coffee have been improved recently.",
