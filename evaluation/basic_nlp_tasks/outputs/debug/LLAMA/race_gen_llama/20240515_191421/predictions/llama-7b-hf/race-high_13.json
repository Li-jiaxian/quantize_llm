She was covered by a destroyed house. Through gaps   of those ruins,the rescuers could see her last posture  . It was something like an ancient person who was kowtowing  ,but it just looked strange because she was out of shape by pressure.\nThe rescuers confirmed her death by touching her through the gaps of the ruins. They shouted at the ruins again and again,knocked the bricks using various tools,but no reply inside.\nThen the rescuing team went to the next building. Suddenly the leader ran back,calling \"Come here.\" He came to the body,put his hands under the woman,feeling and touching,then shouted loudly and gladly,\"There is someone,a baby,still living.\"\nThrough some efforts,rescuers cleaned up the ruins which blocked her. Under her body lay her baby,who was covered by a small red quilt . He was about 3 or 4 months' old. Since well protected by his mother's body,he was safe. He was in a deep sleep when the rescuer carried him out,and his lovely and peaceful face warmed everyone around him. The doctor,along with the rescuing team,took the baby out of the quilt to check if the baby was all right,and he found there was a mobile phone in the quilt. The doctor looked at the screen;a written message was already there:\"My dear baby,if you could live,don't forget how much I love you.\" As a doctor,he experienced much of this type of separation;but at this moment,he cried.

But larger pieces sometimes survive the extreme heat and hit the ground or the ocean at great speeds. So there is always concern that something may fall from the sky and do some harm.\nBut space junk falling on housetops   is not the biggest worry.

They came to present their ideas for using technology to solve world problems.\nMicrosoft education director Suzi Levine says the nine-year-old program began mainly as a competition to create technology.\nSUZI LEVINE: \"When we realized that students really actually want to have a purpose for what they're creating, we introduced the idea of inspiring them with the UN Millennium Development Goals and suggesting that they use those for their muse . \"This past year we also rolled out something called the Imagine Cup Solve This library , where IGOs, NGOs and nonprofits can submit some of the technical challenges that they would like students to consider for their solutions.\"\nMicrosoft says over 350,000 high school and college students registered for this year's competition. Judges chose more than four hundred of them to attend the finals.\nSUZI LEVINE: \"One from Thailand was called NewKrean, where they created a Windows Phone 7 application that allows you to broadcast your location to your social network of friends so that you can be more easily rescued.\" They named their application Terra.\nSuzi Levine says there were also ideas from Egypt inspired by the revolution that _ president Hosni Mubarak in February.\nSUZI LEVINE: \"One was to use Bluetooth as sort of a Twitter equivalent so that if the government shuts down the Internet, you actually can still have a massive social distribution.\"\nStudents competed in nine categories. For example, in software design the top prize of twenty-five thousand dollars went to Team Hermes from Ireland. The students developed a device for cars to collect information on road conditions, driving behavior and traffic incidents.\nA team from Taiwan's National Tsing Hua University won first place in the embedded  development category. They developed a network of wireless devices to help plot the safest escape routes during a fire.\nNext year's awards ceremony will take place in Australia. Registration for Imagine Cup twenty-twelve opened Friday. Also, Microsoft announced plans for a three million dollar program to help Imagine Cup winners further develop their projects.\n\nQ: Which of the following is true ?\n\nA.
