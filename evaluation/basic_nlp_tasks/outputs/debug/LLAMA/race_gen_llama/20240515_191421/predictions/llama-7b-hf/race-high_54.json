Under the Dome, a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing was released on video-sharing websites in China on Feb 28. It has rapidly pushed the public awareness about air pollution and encouraged people to join in efforts to make a difference.\nChai, 39, said she started the work out of her \"personal clashes\" with smog after she gave birth to a daughter. \"I sealed tight all the windows. I started every day by checking the air pollution index,\" Chai said. Millions of other people are also doing the same. While they stop there, Chai goes deeper. \"I don't want to live in this way. 1 need to find out where the smog comes from and what on earth is going on.\"\nOver a year, she investigated polluted sites to find the sources of smog, visited the US and the UK to learn about their anti-pollution experiences, and interviewed officials, scientists and the general public. Chai's research reveals that the burning of coal and oil contributes to 60 percent of PM2.5 pollutants. She thus questions the country's energy consumption habits in the film.\nShe then goes on to disclose loopholes   in car emissions regulations. The film also explains that businesses are pressured not to abide by  the laws because violating  them carries little or no cost, while making changes bumps up costs. The film also points at China's petroleum and steel industries as the biggest sources of air pollution.\nCheng Chen, a 22-year-old student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, found the documentary \"very inspiring\". \"I used to think it's not my duty to deal with air pollution--I don't own a factory or a car,\" said Cheng. \"But Chai told me we share the same fate since we breathe the same air and there is a lot I can do.\"\nHowever, some people are annoyed by the film's description of their polluted hometowns, especially when it shows a banner from Xingtai in Hebei saying \"Congratulations to our city for no longer being ranked the last place among the country's 74 cities in terms of air quality\".\n _ \"What's important is that Chai's work has raised public attention toward the structure of the energy industry,\" she said.

If the Internet had only this very fast search engine, it would have justified its existence many times over. It is the most popular search engine on the web with a 54% market share, ahead of Yahoo! You type almost anything, however unclear, into the space provided and in a second it has come up with hundreds of references. If knowledge is power, then Google commands the gateway.\nYahoo Becomes Giant\nYahoo(www.yahoo.com) was the first wonder of the web, and in many respects, it still is. It started in January 1994 when two California graduate students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, started compiling a database of links, mainly for their personal use. But well before the end of the year, it had become recognizable as Yahoo we know today. In the past seven years, Yahoo had grown rapidly, partly through a long string of buys. Yahoo now offers almost everything you could want: emails, instant messages, chats, clubs, photo albums and a lot more.\neBay Enables Everyone to Buy and Sell\neBay(www.ebay.com),which deals with online trading and shopping services, is the most impressive large Internet company where people buy and sell goods and services worldwide. It has, for instance, opened up a global marketplace in which people from Beijing, San Francisco, or Moscow can bid against each other for products put up for sale by someone in London. The company's online service permits sellers to list items for sale, buyers to bid on items of interest, and eBay users to browse through listed items that is available online seven days a week.\nAmazon Makes Buying a New Experience\nAmazon(www.amazon.com)started out as an online bookstore, constantly putting up new book titles it offered for sale. In the late 1990s, Amazon had more than four million titles after adding CDs, videos, DVDs and games, It continued to add new lines of business including toys, computer software, electronics, like MP3 players, power tools, home improvement products and online sales. For regular users, Amazon has made itself the shortest possible path between wanting and buying.\n\nQ: Which of the following is true?\n\nA. Buying and selling can only be done through Amazon.\nB.

We can see its light and feel its warmth. The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation   of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms  on the Earth.\nMuch of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere,30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food.\nMany gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases.\nWhen sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter. Dark-coloured surfaces, such as dark soil or forest, absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air.\n\nQ: According to the passage, the root( ) cause for weather changes on the Earth is  _  .\n\nA. the atmosphere surrounding the Earth\nB. water from oceans and lakes\nC. energy from the Sun\nD. greenhouse gases in the sky",

Let's listen to what she said.\n   While eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table.

Subterranean insects issue chemical warning signals through the leaves of the plant. This way, aboveground insects are warned that the plant is already \"occupied\".\n     Aboveground, leaf-eating insects prefer plants that have not yet been occupied by subterranean root-eating insects. Subterranean insects send out chemical signals through the leaves of the plant, which warn the aboveground insects about their presence. This messaging makes it possible for spatially-separated insects to avoid each other, so that they do not compete for, the same plant.\n     In recent years it has been discovered that different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that also have subterranean insects and 'vice versa  . It seems that a mechanism   has developed through natural selection,  which helps the subterranean and aboveground insects to communicate with each other. This avoids unnecessary competition.\n      Through the \"green telephone lines\", subterranean insects can also communicate with     _ , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars  . Parasitic wasps   lay their eggs inside aboveground insects. The wasps also benefit from the signals sent by the leaves, as these help them find more insects for their eggs.\n     The communication between subterranean and above- ground insects has only been studied in a few systems. It is still not clear how widespread this phenomenon is, say the researchers.\n\nQ: How do subterranean and aboveground insects communicate with each other?\n\nA. By sending signals through the leaves.\nB. By giving off particular smells.\nC. By making soft and beautiful sounds.\nD. By the signals sent by parasitic wasps.",

The wasps also benefit from the signals sent by the leaves, as these help them find more insects for their eggs.",
