You'll get a 10-cent discount, and it's one less paper cup to end up in a dustbin. The store won't create more waste when they throw away a cup.\nWAY 2: Turn off your computer. If you don't do that, your PC is still using energy. Turning off a monitor   for 40 hours a week may only save $ 5 a month, but it reduces CO\nby 750 pounds.\nWAY 3: Reuse plastic bags. Instead of throwing away 100 billion plastic bags a year, try and get a second, third, or tenth use out of them. Better yet, next time you shop, try a reusable bag. Oil that is used for making just 14 plastic bags would run your car for one mile.\nWAY 4: Use recycled paper in the bathroom. Most of the toilet paper we use is made from trees found in forests. If every family replaced one roll of toilet paper with a recycled one, 424,000 trees would still be standing.\nWAY 5: Plant a tree. Adding green to your garden is beautiful and earth-pleasing. Just one tree will help make cleaner air and save the environment from 5, 000 pounds of hot CO\neach year.\n\nQ: What are the uses of planting a tree?\n\nA. To make your garden beautiful\nB. To help make cleaner air\nC. To save environment\nD. All of above",
