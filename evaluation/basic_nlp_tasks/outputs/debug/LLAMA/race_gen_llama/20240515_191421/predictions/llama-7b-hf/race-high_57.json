However, the plant is grown not only for its beautiful flowers, but also for its oil that has a host of health benefits. Sunflower oil prevents diseases, lowers cholesterol levels, keeps the heart healthy, and even prevents certain forms of cancer. Sunflower oil is a kind of \"magic oil\" when it comes to skin care, as it makes your skin soft and smooth, and prevents signs of aging. So, let us know more about its effects on your skin.\n1.

For example, modern com has been produced to such a large size that it is no longer able to reproduce without man's assistance. Modern dairy cows produce too much milk and if they are not often emptied of milk, they could leak, burst, become infected, and possibly die. Besides, most dogs raised by people can not survive in the wild even with special training.\nSince natural evolution is extremely slow and mankind's selective production programs only take a few generations to produce a completely new species, natural evolution has already _ mankind's production programs. In addition, mankind has successfully killed off several species all together. For example, there are no more European wolves in existence and mammoths   probably died out because of mankind. Even certain diseases have been permanently got rid of from the planet, and dozens of other diseases will soon be too. Again, natural evolution did i>>t cause most of the destruction during man's rule of the world.\nCurrently, scientists are creating new species with desired characteristics in the lab significantly faster than natural evolution creates new species. In a single generation, new species can be created and destroyed by mankind, while natural evolution could take thousands of years to do the same but only accidentally. Scientists are even able to replace defective   or damaged genes with different genes to attempt to cure genetic defects. This is something that natural evolution could possibly never correct.\nEventually scientists will even be able to improve the quality of people. For example, imagine not only correcting your eyesight with gene treatment, but also ensuring that all of your children do not receive your old genes of poor eyesight too. Scientists will one day be able to improve the memory and intelligence of your children, so that they will do better in school and achieve more in life. Doctors and scientists will be able to customize   babies before they are born just like picking options at a car store.\n\nQ: What can we infer from the passage?\n\nA. Near-sighted parents will be able to produce babies with good eyesight in the future.\nB. Doctors and scientists will be responsible for mass production of babies in the future.\nC. It is natural evolution that is to blame for the destruction of European wolves and mammoths.\nD. Children can now have their memory and intelligence improved with the help of gene treatment.",
