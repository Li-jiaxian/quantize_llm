Many male birds like the northern cardinal are brightly color1ed to attract females.Bright feathers can be a sign of how healthy the bird is! Female birds are naturally attracted to healthier males because their offspring will be healthier.Female birds are often less colorful. This helps hide them when they are nesting. \nAdvertising color1ation is also used to warn animals away.The ladybug has bright orange wings with black spots.Its color1ing warns meat-eating animals that the ladybug tastes awful. The striped skunk has white stripes that are a warning to meat-eating animals that they may be in for a nasty surprise if they try to attack. \nSome animals,like the red-eyed tree frog,may scare prey away with their color1, Red-eyed tree frogs sleep during the day.If a meat-eating animal comes up to them and they open their eyes,the bright red color1 of their eyes might shock the predator long enough to give the red-eyed flog time to hop away to safety.\n\nQ: Which of the following would the writer probably agree with?\n\nA. female northern cardinal may have color1ful and bright feathers.\nB.

Visitors have fallen to around 3 million a year from 3.5 million since Ling Ling's death.\nSince a boat collision near the Diaoyu Islands in September, Sino-Japanese relations have been at a low point.

Qingming Jie was proclaimed a Chinese national holiday in 2008. It is a time for remembering loved ones who have departed  . People visit their ancestors' graves to sweep away the dirt and get rid of any weeds. They also leave offerings   of food and flowers, and burn incense   and paper money. Chinese tombs are usually built in the woods or on mountains, far from the city. It is believed that an area that faces south, with many pine trees, is a proper place for a tomb. People believe such a place will make the ancestors happy, and in return, they will look after the living family.\nNowadays, more and more residents are choosing environmental-friendly ways to spend the holiday such as flower sacrifices and memorial ceremonies on the Internet or at home. As one of the traditional ways to celebrate Tomb-sweeping Day - burning paper or incense - isn't exactly good for air quality.\nIn contrast to the sadness of the tomb sweepers, people also enjoy hope of Spring on this day. The Qingming Festival is a time when the sun shines brightly, the trees and grass become green and nature is again lively. Since ancient times, people have followed the custom of Spring outings. At this time tourists are everywhere.\nMany people fly kites on Tomb Sweeping Day. They are usually made from a bamboo crossbow with coloured paper. The kite vibrates and buzzes as it rises into the sky, counterbalanced by its tail. Large kites can be as broad as three metres across, with a tail of six to ten metres.

They hope to understand what makes one child respond to another, how babies adjust their look to their hands and feet to handle objects, and how these very young children adapt to changes.\nThe findings provided by these eye-trackers suggest that babies may be more capable of understanding and acting on what they see than had been thought. \"Quick looks at their mothers' faces may be all they need to get the information they want. They seem to be surprisingly efficient,\" said John Franchak who studies psychology at New York University.\nAlthough sight might largely seem effortless to us, in reality we actively choose what we look at, making about two to four eye movements every second for some 150,000 motions   daily, said Karen Adolph, also a developmental psychologist at N.Y.U. \"Sight is not passive,\" she said. \"We actively adjust our eye movements to the motions of our hands and bodies.\"\nEye-tracking studies have existed for more than a century, but the instruments involved were typically desk machines.

On Friday, I had a discussion with working women in Rhode Island about the economic challenges they face in their own lives--challenges shared by many of you.\nThanks to the work we've all put in, our economy has come a long way these past six years. Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs. For the first time in six years, the unemployment rate is below 6 percent. And on Thursday, we learned that over the past six months, our economy has grown at its fastest pace since 2003.\nBut the gains of a growing economy aren't yet felt by everyone. So we've got to harness  this momentum , and make the right choices so that everyone who works hard can get ahead.\nIn recent weeks, I've talked about these choices, from raising the minimum wage to creating new jobs in construction and manufacturing. Today, I want to focus on what I discussed with those women -- the choices we need to make to help more women get ahead in today's economy.\nRight now, women make up almost half of our workers. More women are their family's main _ than ever before. So the simple truth is, when women succeed, America succeeds. And we should be choosing policies that benefit women--because that benefits all of us.\nWomen deserve fair pay. Even though it's 2014, there are women still earning less than men for doing the same work. We don't have second-class citizens in this country--we shouldn't in the workplace, either. So let's make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, and have a fair shot at success.\nWomen deserve to be able to take time off to care for a new baby, an ailing parent, or take a sick day for themselves without running into hardship. So let's make sure all Americans have access to paid family leave .\nPregnant workers deserve to be treated fairly. Even today, women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks, or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant. That's wrong--and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect.\nNew parents deserve quality, affordable childcare. There's nothing like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your kids are safe while you're at work. And the benefits that children get out of early enrichment can pay off for a lifetime. But in many states, sending your kid to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. So let's start demanding Pre-K for our kids.\nAnd when most low-wage workers are women, but Congress hasn't passed a minimum wage increase in seven years, it's long past time that women deserve a raise. About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour. And more than half of those workers are women. The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit, too. So let's do this -- let's give America a raise.\nAll of these policies are common sense. All of them are within our reach. We've just got to speak up and choose them. Because they'll build a stronger America for all of us.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.\n\nQ: Which is the true fact according to the passage?\n\nA.

Even today, women can be fired for taking too many bathroom breaks, or forced on unpaid leave just for being pregnant. That's wrong--and we have to choose policies that ensure pregnant workers are treated with dignity and respect.\nNew parents deserve quality, affordable childcare. There's nothing like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your kids are safe while you're at work. And the benefits that children get out of early enrichment can pay off for a lifetime. But in many states, sending your kid to daycare costs more than sending them to a public university. So let's start demanding Pre-K for our kids.\nAnd when most low-wage workers are women, but Congress hasn't passed a minimum wage increase in seven years, it's long past time that women deserve a raise. About 28 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to ten dollars and ten cents an hour. And more than half of those workers are women. The local businesses where these workers spend their money would benefit, too. So let's do this -- let's give America a raise.\nAll of these policies are common sense. All of them are within our reach. We've just got to speak up and choose them. Because they'll build a stronger America for all of us.\nThanks, and have a great weekend.\n\nQ: The best title for this Weekly Address may be   _  .\n\nA. Say no to sex discrimination.\nB.
