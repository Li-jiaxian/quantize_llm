There were four of them and there were four completely different cups on the tables.\n\"I heard there was a teacher who took all his students for tea. His students were surprised that all the cups on the table were different. They all took a cup and started drinking their tea, each looking at the cups of others. The teacher said, \"Did you notice your behavior? You are all looking at each other's tea cup and some of you even envy the finer cups of others.\"\n\"I put the different cups here on purpose. I want to say life is like this tea. You all have the same thing in your cups----tea. And yet you cannot truly enjoy it in your envy of another's cup. You forget to enjoy your own life when you envy someone else's life. We all have the same thing----life. We should care more about the tastes of your own life. So now, taste your own tea. Does it matter from which cup it came from?\" Mary finished telling her story and her students all sat in silence for a while, enjoying their tea. And it really did not matter a bit from which teacup they drank.\n\nQ: Which is the best title for the story?\n\nA. More than tea in a cup\nB. The same cups, the same tea\nC. The taste of the tea\nD.
