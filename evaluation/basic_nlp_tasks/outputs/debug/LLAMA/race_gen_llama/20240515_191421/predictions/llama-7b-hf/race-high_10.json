Second, many parents want their children to be able to get into the best colleges and universities.

They earned their living by traveling the famous Silk Road.\nThe Silk Road was not a simple trading network. It passed through thousands of citied and towns. It started from eastern China, across Central Asia and the Middle East, and ended in the Mediterranean Sea. It was used from about 200 B, C, to about A, D, 1300, when sea travel offered new routes  , It was sometimes called the world's longest highway. However, the Silk Road was made up of many routes, not one smooth path. They passed through what are now 18 countries. The routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun, deep snow and even battles. Only experienced traders could return safe.\nThe Silk Road got its name from its most prized product. Silk could be used like money to pay taxes or buy goods. But the traders carried more than just silk. Gold, silver, and glass from Europe were much found in the Middle East and Asia. Horses traded from other areas changed farming practices in China.

You might not think so, but people in China eat on average   about 12 grams of salt each day, that is much higher than the 6 grams suggested by the World Health Organization. You could be eating too much without realizing it, because about 75% of the salt we eat is already in the food we buy, such as bread, sauces, soups and sausages.\nWhat problems can eating too much salt cause? To answer that question, first let's take a look at what salt is.\nSalt is a chemical compound. It is made of sodium   and chloride  . Salt is used to keep and flavor foods. A small amount of salt is important for good health because our bodies need sodium and chloride to work.\nBut past studies have found that people who eat more salt than they need tend to have high blood pressure. Eating too much salt has also been connected with other conditions, such as heart and kidney   problems.\nIf you want to cut down on salt, the good news is, there are plenty of simple things to do.

Outside, lightning lit up the sky, and thunder shook the house. Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding. Lubeck walked down to see what happened; he opened the door to the kitchen, and flames  just went out. The sudden strong wind from the doorway immediately created a large fire from a small one, probably caused by lightning. Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911. \"I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway,\" he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble. His daughter and granddaughters, who lived with him, were away for the night. \nUp a hill lived Lubeck's neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife. From his house, Wentworth saw the black smoke. He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911. On the phone, the 911 worker warned Wentworth not to enter the house. \"But I told the worker, \"Sorry, but I'm going in. I can hear Lubeck shouting \"Help me!\" I can't let myself do nothing in this situation,\" /he says. \"I went in and shouted, \"Donald, where are you?\" Then I had to run outside to catch my breath.\" After one more try inside the house, he gave up. Then the wind parted the smoke just enough for him to see Lubeck on the second-floor bedroom. But there was no way to get to him.\"I finally noticed a ladder,\" says Wentworth.
