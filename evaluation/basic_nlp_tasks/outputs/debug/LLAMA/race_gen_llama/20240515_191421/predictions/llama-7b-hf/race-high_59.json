This foreign houseplant can be enjoyed by anyone, not just brides. With a little proper attention and careful planning on location, this foreign houseplant, which is from Madagascar, can be brought into the home where it can become an interesting focus.\nCaring for the Hawaiian Wedding Plant is not much different from caring for any other houseplants that may already be in your home. The only difference between this type of houseplant and others is the amount of the basic requirements that this foreign houseplant needs to survive and perform beautifully. During the growing season, this plant requires its wet soil, but when winter rolls around, this plant needs its soil to be kept drier.\nHawaiian Wedding Plants should also be potted in well-drained soil and placed in a location that receives full sun. That the soil must be kept wet does not mean that it should sit in water, so the soil must drain easily or this plant will not survive. Water the plant daily and feed this plant every two to three weeks with a little fertilizer  for acid-loving plants. Prune in early spring, even as early as February. If these needs are met, this plant will stay beautiful.\nThe most special feature of this foreign houseplant is its long lasting blooms combined with its unbelievable sweet smell.

Their critics seem to resent(...) them because they have a gift for self-promotion and because they have so much money to throw around. 'It's unjust,' they say, 'that this entirely unproductive industry (if we can call it that) should absorb millions of pounds each year. It only goes to show how much profit the big companies are making. Why don't they stop advertising and reduce the price of their goods? After all, it's the consumer who pays...'\nThe poor old consumer! He'd have to pay a great deal more if advertising didn't create mass markets for products. It is precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so cheap. But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods. Another equally important function is to inform. A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read. Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about. Supposing you wanted to buy a washing machine, it is more than likely you would obtain details regarding performance, price, etc., from an advertisement.\nLots of people pretend that they never read advertisements, but this claim may be seriously doubted. It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days. And what fun they often are, too! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements. Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading railway byelaws  while waiting for a train? Would you like to read only closely printed columns of news in your daily paper? A cheerful, witty advertisement makes such a difference to a dull wall or a newspaper full of the daily ration  of disasters.\nWe must not forget, either, that advertising makes a positive contribution to our pockets. Newspapers, commercial radio and television companies could not survive without this source of revenue . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers. Just think what a newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full price!\nAnother thing we mustn't forget is the 'small ads.' which are in virtually every newspaper and magazine.  What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community! Just about anything can be accomplished through these columns. For instance, you can find a job, buy or sell a house, announce a birth, marriage or death in what used to be called the 'hatch(giving birth), match and dispatch' column but by far the most fascinating section is the personal or 'agony' column . No other item in a newspaper provides such entertaining reading or offers such a deep insight into human nature.

For a merchant, the answer is obvious.By putting charge slips  in a bank, the merchant can change credit card sales into cash.In return for processing the merchant's credit card transactions , the bank charges a fee that ranges between 1.5 and 5 percent.\n         The easiest way to establish credit is to open checking and savings accounts at your local bank.Then apply for a gasoline or store credit card.These cards are fairly easy to get because retailers  want you to buy their goods and services.The third step, and the most dangerous one, is obtaining a major credit card like Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.\n       It is important to choose a credit card carefully because terms and conditions vary widely.Annual fees range from $15 to $75 a year, but some credit card companies charge no annual fee at all.If you will be one of the growing number of people who don't pay off their credit card debts in full each month, look for the card with the lowest interest rate.Interest rates generally range from 12 to 18 percent, though it is possible to find cards with lower rates.\n       A credit card can be your friend because it can get you through unexpected emergencies.And if there is a problem with the products or service you purchase with your credit card, you have an opportunity to hold back payment by asking the credit card company to \"charge back\" to the retailer until the argument is settled.Monthly credit card statements can also help you keep your records in order.Finally, if you make payments on time, the card helps you to establish a good credit history.\n       A credit card can be your enemy because it is an invitation to purchase items you really do not need.The credit card companies' continuous offers of minimum payments, cash advances, and even months without payments may seem like a way to skate through a money crisis.In reality, your finance charges and fees only increase, and you go deeper into debt.\n       If you do find yourself in trouble, do not ignore the bills.Contact your creditors to explain your problem and express your desire to pay down your card balance.If that fails, a nonprofit organization like Consumer Credit Counseling Service can assist you in getting back on your financial feet.\n\nQ: How does the merchant change credit card sales into cash ?\n\nA. With the help of Consumer Credit Counseling Service.\nB. By opening a checking and savings account at the local bank.\nC. By giving the bank the authority to charge.\nD.

It was quite right to compare demographic growth to \"a long, thin powder fuse that bums steadily and hesitatingly until it finally reaches the charge and explodes\".\nTo understand the current situation, which is characterized by rapid increases in population, it is necessary to understand the history of population trends. Rapid growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Looking back at the 8,000 years of demographic history, we find that populations have been virtually stable or growing very slightly for most of human history. For most of our ancestors, life was hard, often nasty, and very short. There was high fertility in most places, but this was usually balanced by high mortality. For most of human history, it was seldom the case that one in ten persons would live past forty, while infancy and childhood were especially risky periods. Often, societies were in clear danger of extinction because death rates could exceed their birthrates. Thus, the population problem throughout most of history was how to prevent extinction of the human race.\nThis pattern is important to notice. Not only does it put the current problems of demographic growth into a historical perspective, but it suggests that the cause of rapid increase in population in recent years is not a sudden\nenthusiasm for more children, but an improvement in the conditions that traditionally have caused high mortality.\nDemographic history can be divided into two major periods: a time of long, slow growth which extended from about 8000 B.C. till approximately 1650 A.D. In the first period of some 9,600 years, the population increased from some 8 million to 500 million in 1650. Between 1650 and 1975, the population has increased from 500 million to more than 4 billion. And the population reached 6.2 billion throughout the world by the year 2000, One way to appreciate this dramatic difference in such abstract numbers is to reduce the time frame to something that is more manageable.

Between 8000 B.C. and 1650, an average of only 50,000 persons was being added annually to the world's population, At present, this number is added every six hours. The increase is about 800000,000 persons annually.\n\nQ: The author of the passage intends to  _  .\n\nA. warn people against the population explosion in the near future\nB. find out the cause of rapid increase in population in recent years\nC. present us a brief and clear picture of the demographic growth\nD. compare the demographic growth pattern in the past with that after 1650",

It occurred to me that this may not be the most dignified posture for a Buddhist nun .\nI had seen the old lady from the seat in front of me as she walked up and down the passage with a flashlight. I asked a few times what was wrong, but she didn't answer at first --- she couldn't hear me. She was wearing a woolen coat. Judging from her accent, she came from Eastern Europe.\nDo you know what hearing aids cost? Thousands, especially for the new tiny hidden-in-the-ear type she described. It takes a long time for an appointment to make a new one, and many doctor visits to get the thing adjusted right. Therefore, my dignity seemed less important than finding that hearing aid. But how does one find a tiny black object in a shadowy jet cabin ?\nThe lady wasn't even sure where or when she had lost it. At one point, a couple of flight attendants did a random search around the lady's seat; I wasn't impressed. They left suggesting that she search the seat of her previous flight! My flashlight turned up all kinds of small objects, bits of plastic, broken pieces of headphones.\nThe old lady said that she gave up. Yet I couldn't. After we landed, as passengers streamed past us, I insisted that the lady move aside while awaiting her wheelchair. Then I got into a real down and dirty search among the dust under her seat and on the floor.\nLook! A little peanut-sized shiny black object caught the light of my flashlight in a floor crack near her seat.\nWhat a rush. \"I found it!\"\nWith great astonishment and gratitude, the old lady responded, \"I haven't the words to express my thanks!\"\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the passage?\n\nA. To tell us a story about kind help.\nB. To warn us to be more careful.\nC. To teach us how to find the lost thing.\nD. To present the love from all people on board.",
