However, setting weight loss as a goal is a mistake.\nTo reach our goal of losing weight --- the output, we need to control what we eat --- the input ( ). That is, we tend to care about the output but not to control the input. This is a bad way to construce goals. The alternative is to focus your resolution on the input. Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output.

Have you ever dreamed something that came true later? Maybe you have ESP  .\nESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away.\nHere's an example. A woman was ironing clothes. Suddenly she screamed, \"My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!\" Just then, a telegram came. The woman's father died of a heart attack. He died sitting in a chair.\nThere are thousands of stories like this one on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what's behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example--one of hundreds of dreams that have come true:\nA man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and carriage came by. The driver said, \"There's room for one more.\" The man felt the driver seemed dead, so he ran away.
