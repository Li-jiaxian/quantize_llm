They build huts   in their backyards, and if it is warm and dry outside, they live in those huts for seven days and nights. Living in a sukkah   is meant to remind Jewish people that for 40 years their ancestors   lived in huts in the desert. In modern times, it has also become a reminder that many people do not have a place to call home.\nIn 2010, an American reporter named Hoshua Foer was building his own sukkah when he came up with an idea. He wondered what it would be like to have a competition for people around the world to use their imaginations to create modern sukkahs. It would be a design competition. But the sukkah would have to be built according to Jewish laws. These laws are found in an ancient book called Talmud. Some of the laws are surprising! ks5u\n \n* It can be built on a boat.\n* It must have at least two and a half walls.\nJoshua got in touch with his friend Roger Bennett. They announced the competition in May 2010. More than 600 designers sent plans. Twelve were chosen as finalists  . Then those finalists were each given money so they could build their sukkahs in a park in New York City. People building the final sukkahs were from the United States, France, England, Japan, and Germany.\nMore than 17,000 people voted   for the winners.
