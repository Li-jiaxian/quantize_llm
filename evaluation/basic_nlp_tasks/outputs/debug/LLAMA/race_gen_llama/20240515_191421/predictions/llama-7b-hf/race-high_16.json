A large 2007 study showed an increase of nearly 60 percent in the danger for _ among people whose friends gained weight. And last year, Harvard researchers reported that strong social ties  could improve brain health as we age.\n\"In general, the role of friendship in our lives isn't well realized,\" said Rebecca, a professor at the University of North Carolina. \"Friendship has a bigger effect on our psychological   health than family relationships.\"\nWhile many friendship studies are about the close relationships of women, some research shows that it can do good to men too. In a six-year study of 736 middle-aged men, having friendships reduces the risk of heart attack. Only smoking was as important a danger factor   as having little social support.\nThe exact reason why friendship has such a big effect isn't clear. While friends can send a sick person to the hospital or pick up medicine, the advantages go well beyond physical help. Friendship clearly has a big psychological effect. \"People with stronger friendships feel like there is someone they can turn to,\" said Karen, a doctor. \"The message of these studies is that friends make your life better.\"\n\nQ: The author mentioned smoking in the text to discuss  _  .\n\nA. the cause of heart attack\nB. the danger of having no friends\nC. smoking is bad for men\nD. friends' influence on habits",

While the sport has not _ in North America, it is very fashionable in Europe and even Japan.\nPlayed in an indoor court, cycle ball is similar to soccer in many ways--the aim is to score as many goals as possible, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball.\nThe one big difference? Use of legs is forbidden. Instead, players have to guide the ball across the court, using the front wheels of their bicycles or with their heads. In fact, if a player even touches the floor with his feet during the 14-minute game, it is considered a foul  and the opposing team gets a free kick.\nWhile the game was initially  played with normal bikes, things are a little different now. The seats of these specialized bikes are positioned over the back tire and they sport a single fixed gear, making it easier for the rider to control the constant back and forth movement required for the game. The handlebars  also point straight up so that the competitors can sit upright while playing and they are about twice the weight of normal bikes, which helps with the stability.\nWhile cycle ball may sound a little strange, it is a fast-paced sport that requires much training, skill, and, is also really fun to watch.\n\nQ: Which of the following is TRUE according to the text?\n\nA. Cycle ball is popular both in Japan and other Asian countries.\nB. The cycle ball game is popular all over the world.\nC. A cycle ball game takes 14 minutes.\nD. Cycle ball has to be played with heads, legs or the front wheels.",

Westerners often make mistakes at the table in China or in a Chinese home. In order not to have an embarrassing  experience, here are some things to consider next time you are eating with some Chinese.\nStep1:\nKeep in mind that food is shared. It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.\nStep2:\nRespect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders.

If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person.\n\nQ: How can you use your chopsticks according to the passage?\n\nA.

Sports, clubs, drama, bands and orchestras-these often count toward a student's overall scholarship application evaluation. The same goes for paid (or unpaid) work experience.\n3. Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible. Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring.\n4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.\n*During the application process\n1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind.\n2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic.\n3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility.\n4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off.\n5. Don't wait until the last minute to complete your application, especially if you are applying online. Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline.\n6. If a third party has to complete part of your application, such as providing a letter of recommendation, make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials.\n7. Last but not least, review your application with your parents to make sure you haven't left out any important details.\nGood luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs!\n\nQ: Before you apply for a scholarship, it's best to  _  .\n\nA. pay more attention to grades than to extracurricular activities\nB. focus on only one scholarship application\nC. get as much work experience as possible\nD. begin your preparation as early as possible",
