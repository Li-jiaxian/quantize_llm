Most of them managed to get along fairly well, but one--Francis Blustering, who had been wounded and who never recovered his strength-- was unable to work like others. In time he became very poor. Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. \nOnce, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.\nOne of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \"You refuse, then?\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \"Yes, I cannot allow it.\"\nOne by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.\nA few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \n\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\"\n\nQ: What can we learn from the story?\n\nA. Think twice before you make a judgment.\nB. Blustering is a poor father and husband.\nC. Blustering would rather live alone than be considered a thief.\nD. Blustering is an example we should learn from.",

People ask for information, play games, and share hobbies. Others buy and sell products. Still others look for friendship, or even love.\nUnlike the real world, however, your knowledge about a person is limited to words on a computer screen. Identity and appearance mean very little in cyberspace. Rather, a person's thoughts--or at least the thoughts they type--are what really count. So even the shyest person can become a chat room star.\nUsually, this \"faceless\" communication doesn't create problems. Identity doesn't really matter when you're in a chat room discussing politics or hobbies. In fact, this emphasis(,) on the ideas themselves makes the Internet a great place for exciting conversation. Where else can so many people come together to chat? But some Internet users want more than just someone to chat with. They're looking for serious love relationships. Is cyberspace a good place to find love? That answer depends on whom you ask. Some of these relationships actually succeed. Others fail miserably.\nSupporters of online relationships state that the Internet allows couples to get to know each other intellectually first. Personal appearance doesn't get in the way. But critics of online relationships argue that no one can truly know another person in cyberspace. Why? Because the Internet gives users a lot of control over how others view them. Internet users can carefully craft their words to fit whatever image they want to give. And they don't have to worry about what their \"nonverbal\"  communication is doing for their image. In a sense, they're not really themselves.\nAll of this may be fine if the relationship stays in cyberspace. But not knowing a person is a big problem in a love relationship.
