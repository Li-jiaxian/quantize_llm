A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes. Scanning text is normally a boring process with each page having to be inserted into a scanner, but the team led by Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa uses a high speed camera that takes 500 pictures a second to scan pages as they are turned by workers.\nNormal scanners can only scan the information that is actually before them on the page.

The Food and Drug Administration also says it found no risks in meat and milk from cloned animals.\nThe F.D.A. looked at studies for several years before it announced its decision in a final report this month. The United States Department of Agriculture supported the findings. But it says time is needed to clear the way for marketing meat and milk from clones.\nThe F.D.A. will not require any product to be registered  as coming from clones. A producer would need to label   a product \"clone-free\". The agency   says that could be misunderstood because the food is not different from other food.\nBut activists argue that the F.D.A. based its decision on incomplete research into possible risks. The Center for Food Safety criticized the use of studies supplied by cloning companies. Animal rights activists point out that cloning attempts often fail. They say cloning is cruel and can lead to suffering.\nCongress   has been trying to get the F.D.A. to do more studies. But the agency noted that experts in New Zealand and the European Union had come to the same findings about the safety of food from clones. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan say they want to study it further before taking action.\nProducts from cloning may not be widely used for several years. Clones cost much , which is why they are not widely used for feeding. The Agriculture Department says few clones will ever become food.

Aren't they too expensive?Is everyone able to learn how to use them and not everyone has the chance to access and work with them,how could everything in the future be dependent on them?\"Therefore,I think our society will be split into two parts.One part will work with them and enjoy the benefits that computers can bring and the other part will be pushed out and will actually be far behind the other group.\nAnother question that bothers me is,on the one hand,computers are important  and good things in our life,but they aren't everything.They are good as a help at school,quite often as entertainment,especially for young people,as an necessary tool to help in research etc,but I think we shouldn't be so dependent on them,because computers are only machines and machines can't feel anything be human and sympathetic,and every action performed by computer can be interfered with another person,which could cause these machines to crash or work badly.\nIn conclusion,I would like to say I am not against computers.I use computers,too,but people should be wary all the time.\n\nQ: The writer's main purpose in writing the passage is  _\n\nA. to encourage us to use computers in our society\nB. to advise us to say no to computers from now on\nC. to remind us to care about the problems that computers bring.\nD. to inform us that the computer has become a necessary part of our life",

One-fifth of schools did not require physical education at all.\n    In 2004, Congress passed a law requiring each school district to develop a \"wellness policy\" to promote the students' health by setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity. Those policies are just now taking effect, and some school administrators predict that the next survey will show more marked improvements. Some schools have set out to place health education on the same requirement with academics. In Los Angeles County, Sepulveda Middle School has banned soft drinks and eliminated unhealthy snacks from the school store. Salad, fruit and yogurt are always available in the cafeteria, said Patricia J. Pelletier, the principal. \n    Nearly an hour of physical education is required daily, the school offers after-hours training in distance running, and it has started a class on healthy cooking for parents. \n    \"If kids are healthy and have healthy lifestyles, they're going to be better students,\" Ms Pelletier said. \"They're going to be in school, and they're going to be connected with the teachers in a better way.\"\n    The survey found that nearly two-thirds of schools prohibited tobacco use at all places, including at off-campus functions, up from 46% in 2000. Another finding was that the proportion of states that require middle schools to teach human sexuality grew, to 59% from 46%. \n    The report found a variety of indications of healthier cooking in school cafeterias. 55% reported that they had removed the skin from poultry before cooking, up from 40%, and 46% now use low-fat cheeses, up from 31%.

Hot water was used five hundred years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle.\nThat no longer happens. But we still get in hot water. When we are in hot water, we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble--serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother, if he walks in the house with dirty shoes.\nBeingin deep wateris almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position.\nTo keep your head above wateris a colorful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job.\nWater over the dam is another expression about a past event. It is something that is finished. It cannot be changed. The expression comes from the idea that water that has flowed over a dam cannot be brought back again.\nAnother common expression to hold water, is about the strength or weakness of an idea or opinion that you may be arguing about. It probably comes from a way of testing the condition of a container.; If it can hold water, it is strong and has no holes in it. If your argument can hold water, it is strong and does not have any holes.\nThrowing cold water also is an expression that deals with ideas or suggestions. It means to not like an idea. For example, you want to buy a new car because the old one has some problems. But your wife throws cold water on the idea, because she says a new car costs too much.\n\nQ: If Robert says he is in deep water, we may guess  _  .\n\nA. he is swimming under the water\nB. he is tired of changing shoes\nC. he nearly breaks a law\nD. he faces a difficult choice",
