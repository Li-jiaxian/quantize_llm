But if you want to save a little water and reuse it on your lawns or plants --- or even use it for laundry, dishes, or other needs --- collecting rainwater from your gutter's downspouts  is a _ \nAccording to John C. Davis, writing in E / The Environmental Magazine, just about any homeowner can collect rainwater, given that the roof and gutters do most of the work. And since an inch of rain falling on a 2,000-square-foot roof produces some 1,200 gallons of water, you can harvest enough to water your lawn or garden.\nPlants and grass actually do better when fed rainwater instead of tap water, which is usually treated with substances that can hold back plant growth. Using rainwater can also extend the life of pipes, since the salts added to tap water may gradually damage the pipes. However, homeowners should set up a water purification system if they do plan to use rainwater for inside needs.\nRainwater harvesting can also be good for the local community, as it reduces the erosion, flooding, and pollution associated with heavy rainfall, and reduces dependence on public water supplies. So some states fund rainwater collection systems in their local communities.\nMany varieties of rain barrel  systems, starting at just $100, are available for home use. A typical setup is simply a rain barrel positioned under a gutter's downspout. Skillful homeowners can make their own water harvesting systems, but buying one is a lot easier. Most garden centres offer a range of choices as well as tips.\n\nQ: What is the topic of the passage ?\n\nA. Basic gardening skills.\nB. Water-saving techniques.\nC. Wastewater treatment systems.\nD.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could spend more time on your hobby and less time at work? Maybe it's not an either/or situation. Perhaps you can do both at the same time.\nWhen choosing a career, one of the things you must consider is your interests. Why then do so many people not even think about their hobbies when a hobby is, in fact, an interest? Perhaps it's because even Webster's Dictionary defines a hobby as \"a pursuit (,) outside one's regular occupation  \". Maybe this is a rule you should break. After all, no one ever said your hobby had to stay separate from your occupation. In addition people are usually very skilled at their hobbies. The combination of interest and skill is a very compelling   reason to choose a particular career.\n\"Who's going to hire someone who loves making beaded   jewelry?\" you may ask yourself. Good question. Don't wait for someone to hire you. Start your own business. That may be the best way to combine your hobby with your career. Those with hobbies that involve creating things, i.e. jewelry, clothing, or pottery, may do well to sell those items on their own. Before you go forward with your plans, though, you should find out whether being an entrepreneur   is for you.\nWhen you attempt to turn your hobby into a career, don't forget to do your homework. Even though you may have enjoyed training your pet birds to sing the national song, that doesn't mean you're suitable to be an animal trainer. Be sure to research your career choice completely. There may be aspects of it that just aren't for you. In that case, stick to your day job, as they say, and save your hobby for your free time.\n\nQ: By writing this passage, the writer wants to introduce   _  .\n\nA. how to choose a hobby for your free time\nB. how to develop your own hobby\nC. how to treat your job as a hobby\nD. how to turn a hobby into a career",

Even with your daily troubles, your life is not very hard if you know how to deal with them.\nI know exactly how you feel. Life as a teenager can be hard. You are not a kid anymore, because you are smart enough to observe and analyze your surroundings. However, you are still not an adult because there are still lots of experiences that you need to have and lessons that you need to learn from these experiences. To top it all, the hormonal  imbalance in your body can really mess you up emotionally. I have been there. I was in it for 6 years exploring what life is about.\nAs a teenager, I had a major problem with completing my chores  on time. And at that time, all that I need to do was finish my assignments, study for the upcoming test and clean my room. Now, I have lots of things to do: cooking, cleaning and working while striking a balance between all my relationships related to work, family and friends. That really is a lot of work. So, I will just give you one golden tip, quoting from Benjamin Franklin, \"Never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.\"\nLife becomes much easier because I finish all my work on time and I have enough time to _ . Half the problems as a teenager are because we hate doing things. We'd rather go and have fun than sit down and take care of our duties and responsibilities. That is why you have so much trouble in your life; your parents won't let you go out with friends because you didn't clean your room or your professor is always criticizing you because you haven't finished your assignments.\n\nQ: The author tries to persuade readers mainly by means of   _  .\n\nA. quoting famous sayings by famous people\nB. setting his own experiences as example\nC. listing all of his troubles in his childhood\nD. showing the numerous assignments for children",

The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring.

In one of the most extensive reports on college drinking thus far, a 1997 Harvard School of Public Health study found that 43 percent of college students admitted binge drinking in the preceding two weeks (Defined as four drinks in a sitting for a woman and five of a man, a drinking binge is when one drinks enough to risk health and well - being )\nExperts estimate that excessive drinking is involved in thousands of student deaths a year. And the Harvard researchers found that there has been a dramatic change in why students drink. 39 percent drank \"to get drunk\" in 1993, but 52 percent had the same objective in 1997.\n\"What has changed is the across - the - board acceptability of intoxication  ,\" says Felix Savino at UW - Madison. Many college students today see not just drinking but being drunk as their primary way of socializing.\nThe reasons for the shift are complex and not fully understood. But researchers guess that it may have something to do with today's instant - satisfaction life - style--and young people tend to take into the extreme.\nWhile binge drinking isn't always deadly, it does have other, wide - ranging effects. Academics is one area where it takes a heavy  _ (something paid, lost or suffered). Perhaps because alcohol increases aggression and affects judgement, it is also related to 25 percent of violent crimes and roughly 60 percent of vandalism on campus. Facing the many potential dangers, college campuses are searching for ways to reduce binge drinking.\n\nQ: Why has \"binge drinking\" caused widespread concern?\n\nA. Because it is directly responsible for the academic problem on campus.\nB. Because it has claimed many young lives every year.\nC. Because it has had harmful effects on the students' health and well - being.\nD. Because it is in close connection with school violence.",
