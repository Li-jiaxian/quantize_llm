That's quitea task, but one I feel I have gotten good at.\nMy brother needs more attention than most siblings. When he was nine, he was hit by a pick-up truck on the way to the bus stop and lost use of the lower two-thirds of his body. He's been in a wheelchair for six years. My brother does many things, but sometimes he tries to do things he used to do but can't now. I' m always there with words of encouragement.\nI now watch my brother struggle to do as many things as he can within and beyond his limits. Should he fall, I will be the person to pick him up. I also watch as my younger sisters grow up into intelligent, beautiful young women. Whenever my brother or sisters need a helping hand or words of encouragement, I'm on the job. That's what I, the big brother, am for.\n\nQ: We can learn from the text that a big brother   _  .\n\nA. sometimes takes more responsibilities\nB. must put up with the incredible hardship\nC. can be asked for help whenever needed\nD. is the most important guy in a big family",
