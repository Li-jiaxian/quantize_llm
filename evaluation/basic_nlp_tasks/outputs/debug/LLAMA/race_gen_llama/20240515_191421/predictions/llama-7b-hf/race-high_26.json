In the Sonoran Desert, one climbs into a pine forest at 7,000 feet and a treeless tundra  on the top of the mountain. It may seem that plants at a given altitude are associated in what can be called \"communities\" -groupings of species. The idea is that over time, plants that require particular climate and soil conditions come to live in the same places, and are frequently to be found together. Scientists study the history of plant life and build up a picture of how groups of plants have responded to climate changes and how ecosystems develop. But are these associations, _ are real in the present, permanent?\nA great natural experiment took place on this planet between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, when small changes in the earth's orbit caused great sheets of ice to spread from poles. These glaciers  covered much of North America and Europe to depths of up to two miles, and then, as the climate warmed, they retreated. During this retreat, they left behind newly uncovered land for living things to occupy, and as those living things moved in they laid down a record we can read now. As the ice retreated and plants started to grow near a lake, they release pollen . Some would fall into the lake, sink to the bottom and mix with the sand. By drilling into the lake bottom it is possible to read the record of the plant life around the lake. The fossil record seems clear; there is little or no evidence that entire groups of plants moved north together. Things that lived together in the past don't live together now, and things that live together now didn't live together in the past. Each individual living things moved at its own pace. The fossil record seems to be telling us that we should be thinking about preserving species by giving them room to move about-to respond to environmental changes.\n\nQ: According to the passage, the movement of individual species of plants   _  .\n\nA. occurs in groups\nB. often depends upon the formation of lakes\nC. does not occur in groups\nD. depends upon climate and soil conditions",

In the Sonoran Desert, one climbs into a pine forest at 7,000 feet and a treeless tundra  on the top of the mountain. It may seem that plants at a given altitude are associated in what can be called \"communities\" -groupings of species. The idea is that over time, plants that require particular climate and soil conditions come to live in the same places, and are frequently to be found together. Scientists study the history of plant life and build up a picture of how groups of plants have responded to climate changes and how ecosystems develop. But are these associations, _ are real in the present, permanent?\nA great natural experiment took place on this planet between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, when small changes in the earth's orbit caused great sheets of ice to spread from poles. These glaciers  covered much of North America and Europe to depths of up to two miles, and then, as the climate warmed, they retreated. During this retreat, they left behind newly uncovered land for living things to occupy, and as those living things moved in they laid down a record we can read now. As the ice retreated and plants started to grow near a lake, they release pollen . Some would fall into the lake, sink to the bottom and mix with the sand. By drilling into the lake bottom it is possible to read the record of the plant life around the lake. The fossil record seems clear; there is little or no evidence that entire groups of plants moved north together. Things that lived together in the past don't live together now, and things that live together now didn't live together in the past. Each individual living things moved at its own pace. The fossil record seems to be telling us that we should be thinking about preserving species by giving them room to move about-to respond to environmental changes.\n\nQ: All of the following are true EXCEPT   _  .\n\nA. The ice age occurred when there were small changes in the orbit of the earth\nB. fossil records seem to indicate that plants will be preserved if they have enough room to move\nC. fossil records clearly show that entire groups of plants are unlikely to have moved together\nD. in the ice age glaciers covered the world to depths of up to two miles",

However,there are places in the rocks of the earth's crust where it isn't strongly held together--where faults exist. Along the faults,one rock might push against another with great force. The energy is changed to vibration in the rocks,so they begin to shake and we have an earthquake!\nThe most famous one in North America was the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. Seven hundred people died and property damage amounted to about $425,000,000.The greatest destruction came from the fires that followed the quake.\nOne of the most famous earthquakes in Europe took place in Lisbon,Portugal,in 1755.The city was destroyed and at least thirty thousand people were killed. In 1908,in Calabria and Sicily,a quake killed about seventy-five thousand people. In 1915,in central Italy,hundreds of towns and villages were damaged and thirty thousand people were killed.\nTwo great earthquakes that caused great damage in Asia took place in Tokyo,Japan,and in Gansu Province in China. The Tokyo quake of 1923 killed more than one hundred thousand people and destroyed the city and the city of Yokohama,too.

The study was published in the medical journalLancet.Doctors found that patients who got TXA had a 15percent lower chance of dying from _ than those who didn't get it . They also had a 10 percent lower chance of dying from any other cause, including organ failure and a head injury. The study was paid for by the British government.\nThe drug is commonly used in wealthy countries during elective surgeries  to stop bleeding , but isn't used for accident victims. TXA is off-patent and made by many companies. It costs about $4.5 per gram, and a typical dose is two grams. It is usually given via an injection  and would be relatively easy to introduce, even in poor countries, experts said.\nPrevious tests of the drug regarded its use in elective surgeries, such as heart operations, but this was the first study to test the drug on accident victims. Doctors were worried it might increase side effects such as blood clots  in the heart and lungs, strokes, or heart attacks. There was no evidence of that in theLancet study, though the authors said it was possible they might have missed some of these incidents.\nFor people between 5 and 45, accidents are the second leading cause of death worldwide after AIDS, and about 600,000 injured patients bleed to death every year.

The study was published in the medical journalLancet.Doctors found that patients who got TXA had a 15percent lower chance of dying from _ than those who didn't get it . They also had a 10 percent lower chance of dying from any other cause, including organ failure and a head injury. The study was paid for by the British government.\nThe drug is commonly used in wealthy countries during elective surgeries  to stop bleeding , but isn't used for accident victims. TXA is off-patent and made by many companies. It costs about $4.5 per gram, and a typical dose is two grams. It is usually given via an injection  and would be relatively easy to introduce, even in poor countries, experts said.\nPrevious tests of the drug regarded its use in elective surgeries, such as heart operations, but this was the first study to test the drug on accident victims. Doctors were worried it might increase side effects such as blood clots  in the heart and lungs, strokes, or heart attacks. There was no evidence of that in theLancet study, though the authors said it was possible they might have missed some of these incidents.\nFor people between 5 and 45, accidents are the second leading cause of death worldwide after AIDS, and about 600,000 injured patients bleed to death every year.
