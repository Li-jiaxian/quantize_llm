Ulifeline. org), a Web site where students can get answers to questions about depression by logging on through their universities. The site has been adopted as a resource by over 120 colleges, which can customize it with local information, and over 1.3 million students have logged on with their college ID's.\n\"It is a very solid Web site that raises awareness of suicide, de-stigmatizes mental illness and encourages people to seek the help they need,\"said Paul Grayson, the director of counseling services at New York University, which started using the service nearly a year ago.\nThe main component of the Web site is the Self-screening program developed by Duke University Medical Center that tests students to determine whether they are at risk for depression, suicide and disorders like anorexia and drug dependences. Besides helping students, the services compiles anonymous student date, offering administrators an important window onto the mental health of its campus.\nThe site provides university users with links to local mental health services, a catalog of information on prescription drugs and side effects, and access to Go Ask Alice, a vast archive developed by Columbia University with hundreds of responses to anonymously posted inquires from college students worldwide. For students concerned about their friends, there is a section that describes warning signs for suicidal behavior and depression.\nYet it is hard to determine how effective the service is. The anonymity of the online service can even play out as a negative. \"There is no substitute for personal interaction ,\" said Dr. Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, based in Washington.\n _ \"The purpose is to find out if there are signs of depression and then direct people to the right places,\" said Ron Gibori, executive director of Ulifeline.\nMrs. Satow, who is still involved with Ulifeline, called it \"a knowledge base\" that might have prevented the death of her son, Jed. \"If Jed's friends had known the signs of depression, they might have seen something,\" she said.\n\nQ: Mrs. Satow would probably agree that   _\n\nA. Jed's friends can prevent her son's death\nB. her son's suicide is unavoidable\nC. Ulifeline is a worthwhile website\nD. depression is the final cause of suicides",

Another big advantage is that they are cool ,like something you would see in an action film. At the moment9however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground.

It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane.\n\"The government and the authorities have never thought seriously about a flying car, says Alan Price ,the president of the company that has developed it. \"I wanted a car that could fly and drive ,but it is difficult to find an organization prepared to insure the vehicle against accidents.\nNevertheless?the company hopes to produce and deliver its first flying car soon. The company already has orders for 40 of them. The majority the potential customers are older and some are retired. There have even been orders from some people who have no pilot's license.\nThe flying car will cost around $ 200.000. \"For an airplane,that's a very reasonable price, but for a car, It's quite expensive,\" explains Alan. \"But it just is not possible to make a $ 10,000 flying car yet. \"\nThis latest means of transport will not become a mass-market item in the near future,but in the long term it has the potential to change the way you travel.

Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game.\n\"People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,\" said social worker Ken Yip, \"and this is what is causing a lot of family problems.\" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply.\nThere are people who wish to remain anonymous  for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he doesn't want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime.\nName or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter of responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our name that we honor what we say.\n\nQ: What does the writer mean by saying \"Responsibility is the name of the game\"?\n\nA.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his achievements. There are four basic types of blood in the ABO system: A, B, AB and O. Everybody is born with one of these four types of blood. We get blood type, just like hair color and height from parents. Because of the substances  contained in each type, the four groups must be _ carefully, If two different blood types are mixed together, it may put a person into an extremely dangerous situation. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. In an emergency, type O blood can be given because it is most likely to be accepted by all blood types, so it is often called the universal donor. However, there is still a risk. For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal receiver. However, because there can be so many reactions in the blood bank of the hospital.\nThere is a relationship between your blood type and your nationality. Among the Europeans, about 45 percent have type O while 42 percent have type A. The least common is type AB. Other races have different percentage.

In an emergency, type O blood can be given because it is most likely to be accepted by all blood types, so it is often called the universal donor. However, there is still a risk. For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal receiver. However, because there can be so many reactions in the blood bank of the hospital.\nThere is a relationship between your blood type and your nationality. Among the Europeans, about 45 percent have type O while 42 percent have type A. The least common is type AB. Other races have different percentage.

In real life, there are no explosions in space, gas usually doesn't explode from a lit cigarette, and Bruce Willis / Jackie Chan / Will Smith would most likely be in a coma  after getting kicked in the head.\nRecently, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on unconvincing tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what _ are all about.\nTelegraph writer Tom Chivers' first example is from the end-of-the-world movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus capable of destroying Windows, the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. \"It's a good thing they didn't have Norton antivirus,\" jokes Chivers.\nIt's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.\nChivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: \" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road\". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all.\nFew people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly.\nAnd finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die another Day by. In the film the villain  has \"gene therapy\" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible.\n\nQ: What does the text mainly deal with?\n\nA. Plots of some famous movies.\nB.

I wrote fan letters and daydreamed about meeting the objects of my affections. I begged my  parents to attend every rock concert and watch every TV show featuring my favorite celebrities; my friends and I discussed for hours all the things we would say and do when we met our favourite movie stars and pop singers. I drove my mother crazy ! But after a few years, my obsession stars faded as I matured and gained the confidence to socialize with \"real\" boys.\nIn the 35 years since I was a teenager, celebrity worship   has increased among teens due to the explosion of television celebrity gossip shows, and instant access to celebrity news on the Internet. It's no wonder that many teens are obsessed with stars when news programs are often filled with entertainment stories and the lives of celebrities.\nCelebrity worship syndrome   is now considered a personality disorder. While it is normal for teenagers to follow the lives of their favorite stars, parents should try to monitor everything their child finds interesting. Parents should take action if they suspect a teen is too obsessed with celebrities and showing little interest in school or withdrawing from the family.  When teens talk a lot about celebrities and view them as just means of entertainment, this is considered normal celebrity worship. However, when a teenager is obsessed with a star and  often expresses a desire to have a close personal relationship with a celebrity or feels they have a special connection to a star, this may be the time for concern. Recent studies have shown that teens who develop an unhealthy obsession with celebrities often suffer from low self confidence and depression. Teens who are overly obsessed with stars often have damaged relationships with their parents.\n\nQ: Parents should become concerned when their children  _  .\n\nA. talk a lot about celebrities with others\nB. put up celebrity posters in their bedrooms\nC. ask to go to their favourite star's concert\nD. desire a close personal relationship with their favorite star",

Any guard who fell asleep while on duty was thought to be \"not worth his salt\", and as a result he would get a little less salt on his next payday. The expression, \"not worth his salt\", is still used today in English.\nIn the modern world salt has many uses beyond the dining table. It is used in making glass and airplane parts, in the growing of crops, and in the killing of weeds  . It is also used to make water soft, to melt   ice on roads and highways, to make soap, and to fix colors in cloth.\nSalt can be got in various ways besides being taken from mines underground. Salt water from the ocean, salt water lakes or small seas can be used to make salt. Yet, no matter where it comes from, salt will continue to play an important role in the lives of people everywhere.\n\nQ: The expression \"not worth his salt\" used today refers to the one who   _  .\n\nA. fails to do his work well\nB. should not be paid in salt\nC. doesn't want to work at all\nD. should use less salt",
