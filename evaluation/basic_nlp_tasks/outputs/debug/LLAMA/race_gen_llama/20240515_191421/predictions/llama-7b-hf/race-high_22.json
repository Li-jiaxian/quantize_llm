Yet when you ask them deeper questions, it turns out that they like to shop. Men generally like to shop for books, music and hardware. But if you ask them about the shopping they do for books or music, they'll say, \"Well, that's not shopping. That's research.\"\n    In other words, what men and women call \"buying things\" and how they approach that task are different. \n    Women will wander through several 1,000-aquare-meter stores in search of the perfect party dress. Men will wander through 100 Internet sites in search of the perfect digital camcorder. Women see shopping as a social event. Men see it as a special task or a game to be won. \n   \"Men are frequently shopping to win,\" says Ann, a marketing professor at Loyola University of Chicago. \"They want to get the best deal. They want to get the best one, the latest one and if they do that it makes them happy.\" When women shop, \"They're doing it in a way that they want everybody to be very happy.\" says Ann. \"They're kind of shopping for love.\"\n   \"Teenage girls learn to shop from their moms and older sisters, but they also learn to shop by examining articles in magazines like Seventeen,\" City University Zukin says. \"And although men's magazines such as GQ and Esquire have long had shopping articles, it's TV that has the eye of young male shoppers,\" say Ann and Zukin. \n   \"Television shows are used by young men in the same way Seventeen magazine or Lucky is used by girls,\" says Zukin, \"to help make clothing and toiletry choices.\"\n   \"Of course, there are men who love to shop and are proud of it.\" Loyola's Ann says. And that is important no matter whether you buy a car or a frying pan. All men love to buy but don't want to get cheated. Ann adds, \"There actually are men who are interested, for example, in cooking or shopping or chinaware or things around the home---they become kind of girl magnets. Women like it.\"\n\nQ: Compared to women, men usually treat shopping more   _  .\n\nA. seriously\nB. honestly\nC. curiously\nD. foolishly",

But when British people say that their society is based on family life, they are thinking of \"family\" in its narrow, peculiarly European sense of mother ,father and children living together alone in their own house as an economic and social unit. Thus, every British marriage indicates the beginning of a new and independent family--hence the tremendous importance of marriage in British life. For both the man and the woman, marriage means leaving one's parents and starting one's own life. The man's first duty will then be to his wife, and the wife's to her husband.

Don't make a noise.\"\nI went downstairs quietly. When I reached the living room, I switched on my torch and looked round the room. Then I turned the light on. I switched the siren off and searched the rooms downstairs. There was nothing wrong except that the back door was unlocked. I locked it, re-set the alarm and went back to bed.\nAbout an hour later, the alarm started again. I jumped out of bed, fell over a chair in the dark and bumped into the bedroom door. Mary woke up and started hitting me with a torch. \"Hey! Wait a minute!\" I whispered. \"It's only me. I' m going downstairs to see what's wrong.\"\nI went down into the living room and listened for a moment. The only sound I could hear was the siren. I turned on the light and then switched the siren off. As I did so, I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows. I saw a house lizard   disappear behind the curtains.\n\"Oh!\" I said to myself. \"That's our burglar.\"\nWhen the lizard moved, it started the siren. I guessed that the alarm had been made in Europe, where there are no house lizards.\nWell, I won't finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge, let me know. I'll send you ours. We bought a dog this morning. It knows the difference between a lizard and a burglar.\n\nQ: The purpose of the writer in writing the passage is to  _  .\n\nA. tell us that the alarm system doesn't work\nB. tell us an interesting experience\nC. show us how the alarm system works\nD. make it clear that he wants to give away his alarm system",

Dogs and cats have been popular Christmas gifts in the gifts in the UK and Europe for many years. But some people still haven't quite got the message.\nThe slogan still holds good. Some 105,000 dogs were _ by local government last year because they had been abandoned, many of them shortly after the festival season.\nThe main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give; behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given.\nBut Eleanor Silk, the Trust's communications director, says, \"It's often four or five months after Christmas, in early summer, when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active, or it hasn't been trained properly and has caused damage around the home.\"\nIn any case, some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy  as a pet, Christmas is not the time to do it. Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings, to be introduced to a routine, and to be looked after like small children. It's hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas. What's more, pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children. It encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy, rather than a responsibility.\nAppreciating what you're taking on with a dog can be a sobering   realization. \"For life\" means thinking about the effect they'll have on your life. It also infers you will need to care for the dog for its whole life.\n\nQ: What would be the best title for the passage?\n\nA. Dogs and Cats--the Most Popular Christmas Gifts.\nB.
