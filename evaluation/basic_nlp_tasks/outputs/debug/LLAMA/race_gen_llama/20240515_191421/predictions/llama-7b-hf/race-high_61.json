All skirts will be banned from September. Tight-fitting trousers will also be forbidden and Muslim head-dresses will have to be \"school blue'' color.\nHead teacher Don Smith said, \"One of the big problems for us at the school has been the number of girls who have been wearing inappropriately short skirts. This has been an area of particular concern at a time when there has been a lot of material nationally about the sexualisation of young people.\"\nHe also said, \" It will be impractical to police the length of girls' skirts. A blanket ban will be easier for staff to put into practice. We did not want to arrive at a situation where we were telling girls their skirts could only be a certain number of centimeters above or below the knee. Pupils', parents' and other teachers' opinions were sought before the uniform rules were changed.,,\nThe new clothing policy has been explained in a letter sent to parents of the school's 1,000 pupils and will come into force after the summer holiday. Support will be given to parents unable to afford the new tie. The school also wants pupils to wear clip-on ties instead of traditional neckties.\nBut the new uniform rules have not been well received by everyone. One parent, whose teenage daughter attends the school, said, \"I completely agree some girls were wearing skirts that were too short. However, I think girls should be allowed to be feminine .Other schools manage to let girls wear skirts while making sure they are not inappropriately dressed. I don't see why Paget can't do the same.\"\n\nQ: What's the best title for the passage?\n\nA. New School Rules Set\nB. Girls' Skirts Forbidden\nC. Traditional Neckties Gone\nD.

Once we have found it, we should try to change that part of out lives. If we believe that we can control stress, we can begin to control out lives. Then we can start to use stress in positive way.\n\nQ: From the text, we can conclude that  _  .\n\nA. if someone has stress he will do something wrong unavoidably\nB. anyone can experience stress when he is out of control\nC. one will feel no stress at all if he gets enough physical exercise.\nD. one is sure to work better because of the stress.",
