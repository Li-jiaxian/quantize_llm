As Morrison scholars will tell you, Love is the third volume of a literary master's trilogy investigating the many complexities of love. This trilogy began with Beloved(1988), which deals with a black mother's love under slavery and in freedom. Jazzy(1993), the second volume, tells a story of romantic love in 1920s Harlem. This latest novel looks back from the 1970s to the 1940s and 50s.\nThe emotional center of Love is Bill Cosey, the former owner and host of the shabby Cosey's Hotel and Resort in Silk, North Carolina, described in the novel as \"the best and best-known vacation sport for colored folk on the East Coast.\" We get to know Cosey through the memories of five women who survive and love him: his granddaughter, his widow, two former employees, and a homeless young girl.\nThe latest novel, Love, had been described in the promotional material from her publisher as \"Morrison's most accessible work since Song of Solomon.\" This comparison to her third novel, published in 1977, was an effective selling point.\n\nQ: The similarity between Love and Song of Solomon is that they both   _  .\n\nA. belong to the same trilogy together with Beloved\nB. concern families of more than one generation\nC. deal with life of blacks under slavery\nD. investigate life in 1920s Harlem",

Morrison is the first black woman to receive a Nobel, and so honored before her in literature are only two black men:Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright, poet and novelist, in 1986; and Derek Walcott, the Caribbean-born poet, in 1992.

Suddenly they saw a lot of very bright spots crossing the computers's screens. At the same time the computers were working much slower. To find out what was happening they stopped their work to check some parts of the computers. To their horror, they found out that most of their stored information was got rid of by computer viruses ! Obviously all these computers had been infected by computer viruses.\nIt is said that the computer viruses were made by a group of young men fond of playing tricks. They all had excellent education. They created the viruses just to show their intelligence . These kinds of computer viruses are named Jerusalem Viruses. These viruses can stay in computers for a long time. When the time comes they will attack the computers by lowering the functions , damaging their normal programs or even getting rid of all the information.\nWe now come to know that Jerusalem Viruses often attack computers on Fridays and that they are spreading to a lot of computers. Among the countries that suffered computer viruses last year are Britain, Australia, Switzerland and the U.S. But fill now , how to get rid of the terrible viruses remains a problem.\n\nQ: The most serious damage caused by the viruses is that  _  .\n\nA. the computer's functions are lowered\nB. the normal programs are damaged\nC. all the information stored in the computers is gone\nD. the computers infected by the viruses can no longer be used",

War is an ancient institution,-which has existed for at least six thousand years.It was always bad and usually foolish, but in the past human race managed to live with it.Modern inventiveness has changed this.Either man will end war, or war will end man.For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the most serious danger, but bacteriological or chemical weapons may, before Iong, offer an even greater threat.If we succeed in ending nuclear weapons, our work will not be done.It will never be done until we have succeeded in ending war.To do  _ , we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not as contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in kiting people, but by agreement with principles of law.It is not easy to, change very old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted.\nThere are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology(,)would prevent war.I believe this to be a big error.All ideologies are based upon dogmatic statements that are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false.Their adherents (,)  believe in them so fanatically\nthat they are willing to go to war in support of them.\nThe movement of world opinion during the past few years has been very largely such as we can welcome.It has become a commonplace that nuclear war must be avoided.Of course very difficult problems remain in the world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago.It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that negotiations should reach agreements even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory.It has begun to be understood that the important conflict nowadays is not between different countries, but between man and the atom bomb.\n\nQ: In the sentence \"To do this, we need to persuade mankind\" (Para l), \"this\" refers to  _\n\nA. abolish war\nB. improve weapons\nC. solve international problems\nD. live a peaceful life",

Think of Thailand's capital city, Bangkok, and the noisy tuk-tuk ( ) may come to mind. Picture the American city of San Francisco and you might see the city's trolleybuses.\nImagining what these cities would look like without their red buses, tuk-tuks or trolleybuses is difficult. They are symbols of these cities that make them different from anywhere else in the world. However, these city symbols, which are so loved by tourists, are not always so well loved by their city leaders. City leaders want what is best for their city, which often means the most modern transport.\nIn Thailand, Bangkok city authorities have forbidden new tuk-tuks because they consider them noisy and polluting. However, the ban has largely been unsuccessful, as it has not changed Thai people's preference for the inexpensive tuk-tuks over taxis.\nIn London, the city's first ever mayor got rid of the red double-decker buses, which he thought were old-fashioned, by selling them to other countries. His plan worked, but Londoners were upset to lose the charming old buses they believed represented the best of their city. They made their upset felt, when the major came up for re-election last year. Most Londoners voted for his competitor who promised to bring the bus back. Now an improved version of the double--decker bus will hit London's streets in 2012..\nAs for San Francisco, several trolleybuses remain in use but mainly as tourist attractions. They are too slow to be used for anything other than scenic trips.\nCity transport symbols may have a place in their city people's hearts, but it seems they are increasingly out of step with the modern world. As Londoners have proved, their continued life depends on people's willingness to fight for their survival.\n\nQ: Bangkok's ban on tul-tuks is unsuccessful due to   _  .\n\nA. people's unawareness of environmental protection\nB. tourists' preference for tuk-tuks over taxis\nC. the lack of severe punishment for violation\nD.
