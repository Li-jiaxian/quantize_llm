Although there is no certain way to avoid all cancers, reducing individual risk factors greatly decreases the likelihood of getting many forms of this dangerous disease.\nThe American Chemical Society estimates that smoking causes nearly 30 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States -- that is, about 166,000 cancer deaths each year. All cancer deaths caused by tobacco smoking could be prevented completely by not smoking and not using smokeless tobacco. For those who already smoke, quitting will reduce the risk of developing cancer. Studies show that after about ten years of not smoking, a past smoker's risk lowers to about the level of those who have never smoked.\nAfter quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet is the best way to lower the risk of cancer. Certain foods have been found to protect against cancer. Among these foods are cabbages, tomatoes, soy products, and foods high in vitamins A, C, and E. In addition, green and possibly black teas contain compounds that protect the body from cancer-causing substance.\nTo lower cancer risk, diets should include little or no red meat. Other foods to avoid or consume in moderation   include sugar, fat from animal products, and salt. Added fats and oils should come from vegetables, such as olives or corn, rather than from animal sources. Carbohydrates   should come from whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat bread, rather than from processed foods, such as white rice and white bread.\nThe risk of cancer of the esophagus   increases with heavy alcohol consumption, and many studies suggest that consuming alcoholic drinks increases the risk of breast cancer as well. Studies show that limiting intake to two drinks a day for men, and one drink per day for women, reduces cancer risk.\nLow levels of physical activity have been implicated   in some cancer. Moderate activity for 30 minutes a day enhances the immune system, shortens the time food takes to move through the intestines  , and changes body composition and hormone levels. Researchers are studying how these effects might lower cancer risk.\n\nQ: Which of the following is true according to the author?\n\nA. A person drinking tea regularly will not be likely to suffer from cancer.\nB. Once a smoker has stopped smoking, there is almost no chance for cancers.\nC. A balanced diet is absolutely effective in preventing one from getting cancer.\nD. Those having quitted smoking for 10 years and non-smokers have less cancer risk.",

Even though we've limited each boy's activities and try our best to defend our family time, it seems that we're in a constant state of flight.\n\"Embrace it. Roll with it,\" my husband, Lonny, says, \"It's going to be like this for a while.\"\nHe is right. It's likely that life will continue to go forward before it slows down. But I remembered the still, quiet days that our family used to enjoy. I missed long walks through the park when we held the boys' little hands. I longed for  lazy Saturday afternoons under the tree in our backyard. I wanted to slip back a few years, when busyness was the exception and not the rule.\nOne night, after a particularly full day and evening games, our family gathered on the porch for ice cream. Two parents, two teens, and three small boys piled on one old swing and a couple of rocking chairs. We were together, in one place, for a small slice of time.\nThe moon was full. The Mississippi River, flowing past our home, was smooth as glass. I wrapped my own arms around the son who sat on my lap and breathed deeply to _ his little-boy scent --dirt and sweat. My heart was still and content .\nI realized that while crazy is our new normal happiness is as usual. They may look different from before, but they are still there--even if they're in the form of a single moment on the porch. Maybe I just need the eyes to see.\n\nQ: Which of the following statements might the author agree to?\n\nA. Life is nothing but bitterness, busyness and horror.\nB. Happiness is everywhere, but we have to discover it.\nC. Parents should earn much money for their kids' better life.\nD. Life in the countryside is charming, wonderful, and sweet.",
