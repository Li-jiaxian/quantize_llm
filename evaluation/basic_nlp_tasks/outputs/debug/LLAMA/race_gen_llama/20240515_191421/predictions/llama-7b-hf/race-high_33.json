All we assume   is that some early men invented certain sounds,in one way or another,to express thoughts and feelings,actions and things,so that they could talk with each other. Later they agreed upon certain signs,called letters,which could be put together to show those sounds,and which could be written down. Those sounds,whether spoken or written in letters, are called words.\nThe power of words,then,lies in their associations--the things they bring up to our minds. Words become filled with meaning for us by experience;and the longer we live,the more certain words bring back to us the happy and sad events of our past;and the more we read and learn,the more the number of words that mean something to us increases.\nGreat writers are those who not only have great thoughts but also express these thoughts in words which have powerful effects on our minds and feelings. This clever use of words is what we call literary style  .Above all,the real poet is a master of words. He can express his meaning in words which sing like music,and which by their position and association can move men to tears.

The British girl has a rare condition called Sleeping Beauty Sickness. Doctors don't know what causes it or how to cure it --only know that it strikes teenagers and goes away by itself after eight to 12 years.\nLouisa's mum, Lottie, told NBC News that the girl had flulike symptoms just over a year ago. Shortly afterward, she had her first period of long sleeping.\nShe was eventually diagnosed with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, whose victims worldwide may number no more than 1,000. The victims live normally for weeks or months at a time, with normal sleep patterns and normal energy levels. Then, with little warning, they'll go to sleep for days or weeks at a time. So far, Louisa's longest period in bed has been 13 days. Victims will wake briefly, but be _ and not fully awake. Louisa's parents force her awake so she can use the bathroom and eat.\nNow, Louisa's friends can tell when a period is coming on. She stops talking and she may be annoyed easily. That's when she knows she has to get home to her bed. Louisa has slept through family vacations, the dance recitals  she loves to perform in, and school tests. Now it becomes increasingly difficult to catch up on missed schoolwork.\nBut just as doctors don't know the cause, they also don't know why it ends as mysteriously as it began. The illness is unrelated to narcolepsy , whose victims are constantly tired and drop off for brief periods of sleep at any time.\nIt's so dramatic that some people have accused Louisa of making the false symptoms to get attention. Her father, Richard, thinks that's absurd.\n\nQ: Which is TRUE about Kleine-Levin Syndrome according to the passage?\n\nA. The victims usually sleep for days or weeks at a time.\nB. There are usually many warning signs before it attacks the victims.\nC. The victims are usually tired and in a bad mood.\nD. There are more than 1, 000 victims in the world.",
