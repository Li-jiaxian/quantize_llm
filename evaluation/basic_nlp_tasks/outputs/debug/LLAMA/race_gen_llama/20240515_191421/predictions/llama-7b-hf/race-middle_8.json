Love wanted to hold out  until the last possible moment.\nWhen the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.\nRichness was passing by Love in a big boat. Love said, \"Richness, can you take me with you?\"\nRichness answered, \"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.\"\nLove decided to ask Vanity  who was also passing by in a beautiful ship.\"Vanity, please help me!\"\n\"I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage  my boat, \"Vanity answered.\nSadness was close by so Love asked, \"Sadness, let me go with you.\"\n\"Oh...Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!\"\nHappiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.\nSuddenly, there was a voice, \"Come, Love, I will take you.\"It was an elder. So thankful and happy, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed  the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, \"Who helped me?\"\n\"It was Time, \"Knowledge answered.\n\"Time?\"asked Love.\"But why did Time help me?\"\nKnowledge smiled with deep wisdom  and answered, \"Because only Time is able to understand how valuable Love is.\"\n\nQ: Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?\n\nA.

You are a nice little boy!\" she said kindly, smiling.\nA special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog and went directly to the river nearby.\n\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy\" he repeated the woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog, \"You are a nice little dog!\" Tiger raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Unum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said. \"Well, Tiger, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tiger waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great power it has!\"\n\nQ: What's the best title of this passage?\n\nA. A Dog and a Boy\nB. A Poor Boy's Childhood\nC. A Businessman and a Boy\nD.
