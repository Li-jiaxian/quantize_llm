The Netherlands is more than 41,500 square kilometres in area. It is a bit larger than the size of Taiwan, China.\nThe Netherlands is rich in culture and art. It is home of many great artists, for example, Vincent van Gogh. Besides fine art, the Netherlands is also called the country of tulips  . It has the world's largest tulip garden: Keukenhof garden.\nDutch people are very hard-working. There's a saying: \"God made the Earth, but the Dutch made Holland.\" More than a quarter of the country is below sea level. So Dutch people build many dams   to protect the country from flooding. They have created almost one sixth of the country from seas and rivers!\nDid you know?\n* Rubber ducks are popular around the world. Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman created it in 2007.
