This difference may explain why men are more likely to suffer from stress-related disorders.\nUntil now, psychological research has maintained that both men and women have the same \"fight-or-flight\" reaction to stress. In other words, individuals either react with aggressive behavior, such as verbal or physical conflict (\"fight\"), or they react by withdrawing from the stressful situation (\"flight\"). However, the UCLA research team found that men and women have quite different biological and behavioral responses to stress. While men often react to stress in the fight-or-flight response, women often have another kind of reaction which could be called \"tend and befriend.\" That is, they often react to stressful conditions by protecting and nurturing their young (\"tend\"), and by looking for social contact and support from others - especially other females ('befriend\").\nScientists have long known that in the fight-or- flight reaction to stress, an important role is played by certain hormones  released by the body. The UCLA research team suggests that the female tend-or-befriend response is also based on a hormone. This hormone, called oxytocin, has been studied in the context of childbirth, but now it is being studied for its role in the response of both men and women to stress. The principal investigator, Dr. Shelley E. Taylor, explained that \"animals and people with high levels of oxytocin are calmer, more relaxed, more  social, and less anxious.\" While men also secrete oxytocin, its effects are reduced by male hormones.\nIn terms of everyday behavior, the UCLA study found that women are far more likely than men to seek social contact when they are feeling stressed. They may phone relatives or friends, or ask directions if they are lost.\nThe study also showed how fathers and mothers responded differently when they came home to their family after a stressful day at work. The typical father wanted to be left alone to enjoy some peace and quiet. For a typical mother, coping with a bad day at work meant focusing her attention on her children and their needs.\nThe differences in responding to stress may explain the fact that women have lower frequency of stress-related disorders such as high blood pressure or aggressive behavior. The tend-and-befriend regulatory  system may protect women against stress, and this may explain why women on average live longer than men.\n\nQ: The UCLA study shows that in response to stress, men are more likely than women to   _   .\n\nA. turn to friends for help\nB. solve a conflict calmly\nC. find an escape from reality\nD. seek comfort from children",

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition   and heat-related health problems.\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was \"a methodological embarrassment\" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable   regions. Dr. Pielke said that \"climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost   attention.\" But the report, he said, \"will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed  .\"\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates.

        "origin_prompt": "Read the article, and answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.\n\nArticle:\nThis Monday,the nation will start to celebrate Presidents' Day,just seven days before George Washington's birthday.Everyone agrees that day is a holiday,but is it just to celebrate George Washington's Birthday? What about Abraham Lincoln? Some government offices call it Presidents' Day.Others say the holiday is officially Washington's Birthday.Confused yet?\nGeorge Washington was elected the country's first President on April 30,1789.Soon after,Americans began publicly celebrating his birthday.Presidential historians say the actual date of George Washington's birth is February 11,1732.But a change in the calendar system 20 years later shifted all dates,making Washington's birthday February 22,which is now well accepted.In 1879.Congress made Washington's birthday an official federal holiday.It was the first federal holiday to celebrate an individual's birthday.In 1968,Congress passed the Monday Holidays Act,which moved the holiday to the third Monday in February.The new law did not change the holiday's name.It was still called Washington's Birthday,even though some lawmakers wanted to call it Presidents' Day to include Abraham Lincoln,whose actual birthday is February 12.\nMany people argue that the holiday should celebrate all past Presidents.They feel Lincoln should be honored for his role in preserving the nation during the Civil War and helping to free slaves.Others feel the holiday should only honor Washington.the country's first President.They say shifting the focus away from Washington would mean future generations of kids would not know about the Father of Our Country.\nLaws have been introduced in Congress over the years to require use of the term \"George Washington's Birthday.\"but none of those laws have been passed.Meanwhile,many state governments and school districts now use the term \"Presidents' Day.\"Many stoles also use it to promote holiday sales.\nShould the holiday honor Washington,Washington and Lincoln,or all past Presidents? Write to emailbag@timeforkids.com and tell us what you think.\n\nQ: What's the best title for this passage?\n\nA. Why people celebrate President Day.\nB. The history and debate behind Presidents' Day\nC. To celebrate Presidents' Day or not\nD. Colorful activities on Presidents' Day",

People who consider themselves ugly have been gathering in Piobbico since the 1960s. That's when Ugly Club president Telesforo Lacobelli established a dating agency for women who believed they were too ugly to attract husbands. Lacobelli believes that he is ugly himself because he has a short nose in a country where long or large noses have always been considered beautiful.\nPeople from around the world travel to Piobbico to tell their sad stories of ugliness. During the annual Festival of the Ugly, which occurs on the first Sunday of every September, hundreds of people gather in Piobbico's town square to elect the president of the Ugly Club. Lacobelli wins the election every year. The Ugly Club has over 20, 000 members. They carry ID cards that grade their ugliness from bearable to extreme. A prize is awarded to Ugly Club members who qualify as extremely ugly.\nThe Ugly Club president insists that ugliness is a virtue. Since beautiful people get a lot of attention for their beauty alone, they have to work hard to prove their other virtues. Ugly people, on the other hand, are genuine and do not have to prove anything to anybody, according to Lacobelli.\nLacobelli is a spokesperson for ugly people everywhere. He believes that the uglier one is, the better life can be. Though the club enjoys making fun of beauty, especially beauty contests, Lacobelli has a serious side as well. He believes that too many people suffer from financial and emotional pressures because they don't meet society's standards of beauty. The fact that beautiful people are more successful in the workforce is a problem that Lacobelli has attempted to bring forward to the Italian public and government.\n\nQ: Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?\n\nA.
