For the same reason that when Charles Dickens was writing David Copperfield 150 years ago girls were absent from the British education system: Men in power mostly prefer _ that way, or are not interested enough in changing the situation to commit energy and money to doing so.\nThe countries with the poorest record for having women in positions of power or influence have the worst figures for girls' education. High-profile intervention  by organizations such as the World Bank has begun successfully with several countries, and more of the same will probably be needed to bring change in conservative, male-run states.\nEven if there were no development payoff from gender equality in schools, the education of girls would still be a cause worth fighting for. Education is a human right, and the denial of it to girls is a scar on the community in the twenty-first century.\nTo be born a girl in a rural area in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Morocco, Togo, or Sudan -- half a dozen of the most shameful performers -- means being condemned to a life without school, education, or clean water, marriage and babies coming too early, too many births, children who die of preventable diseases, backbreaking work in the fields, subordination  to husband and his family, and an early death.\nEvery year, almost 12 million children under the age of five needlessly die of infectious diseases associated with poverty. But each additional year spent by their mothers in primary school lowers the risk of premature child deaths by about 8 percent. In Pakistan, an extra year of school for 1,000 girls could prevent sixty infant deaths.\nWith women and girls being the main farmers in Africa and southern Asia, their education offers a chance to develop more efficient farming practices, improve output, and raise awareness of the ecological needs of the land with tree planting and farming.

In 1852,for instance,a girl sat for her Daguerrotype,her head slightly turned,giving the camera an unsmiling look. She is preserved forever as a very serious girl indeed. Charles Darwin,a loving and playful parent,looks frozen in photographs. Why did our ancestors,from unknown sitters for family portraits  to the great and famous,because so sad in front of the camera?\nThe severity is everywhere in Victorian photographs. However,you don't have to look very long at these unsmiling old photos to see how incomplete the seemingly obvious answer is-that they are freezing their faces in order to keep still for the long exposure times. In Julia Margaret Cameron's Portrait of Tennyson,the poet dreams,his face a shadowed mask of genius. This is not simply a technique. It's an emotional choice.\nPeople in the past did not go around in a continual state of sorrow. In fact,the Victorians had a sense of humor even about the darkest aspects of their society. Laughter was not just common in the past but accepted by society far more than it is today,from medieval carnivals  to Georgian print shops,where people gathered to look at the latest funnies. Far from preventing festivals and fun,the Victorians,who invented photography,also created Christmas as a celebration as it is today. So the severity of people in the 19th-century photographs cannot be the evidence of generalized sadness. This was not a society in permanent desperation. Instead,the true answer has to do with attitudes to portraiture itself.\nPeople who sat for early photographs understood it as a significant moment. Sitting for the camera was cheaper,quicker and meant that people who never had a chance to be painted could now be photographed; but people seemed to have taken it seriously in the same way they would be a painted portrait. Like a portrait painting,it was intended as a timeless record of a person.\nTo me those unsmiling people probably had as much fun as we do,if not more. But they felt no need to prove it with pictures. Instead,when whey sat for a photograph,they thought about time,death and memory. Perhaps we should stop smiling sometimes,too.\n\nQ: What is the author's attitude towards people not smiling in old photos?\n\nA. Skeptical.\nB. Critical.\nC. Neutral.\nD. Positive.",
