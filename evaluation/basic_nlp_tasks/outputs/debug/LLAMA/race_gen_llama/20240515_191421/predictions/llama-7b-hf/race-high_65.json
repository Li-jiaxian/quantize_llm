In a recent study, scientists found a connection between nap-time dreams and better memory in people who were learning a new skill.\nIn the study,99 college students between the ages of 18 and 30 each spent an hour on a compute, trying to get through a virtual maze .The maze was different place each time they tired--making it even more difficult. They were also told to find a particular picture of a tree and remember where it was.\nFor the first 90 minutes of a five-hour break, half of the participants stayed awake and an half were told to take a short nap .Participants who stayed awake were asked to describe their thoughts. Participants who took a nap were asked about their dreams before sleep and after sleep--and they were awakened within a minute of sleep to describe their dreams.\nStickgold, a neuroscientist ,wanted to know what people were dreaming about when their eyes weren't moving during sleep.\nFour of the 50 people who slept said their dreams were connected to the maze. Some dreamed about the music that had been playing when they were working ; others said they dreamed about seeing people in the maze. When these four people tried the computer maze again, they were able to find the tree faster than before their naps.\nStickgold suggests the dream itself doesn't  help a person learn--it's the other way around.He suspects that the dream was caused by the brain processes associated with learning.\nAll four of the people who dreamed about the task had done poorly the first time, which makes Stickgold wonder if the dreams show up when a person finds a new task particularly difficult. People who had other dreams, or people who didn't take a nap, didn't show the same improvement.\n\nQ: Before having a short nap, participants of the experiment were asked to  _  .\n\nA. stay in a different place in the maze\nB. design a virtual maze which is difficult to get through\nC. experience the experiment and try to remember something\nD. get through a virtual maze on a computer from the same place",
