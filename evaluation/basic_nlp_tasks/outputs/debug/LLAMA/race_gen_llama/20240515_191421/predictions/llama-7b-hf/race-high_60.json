But after a little practice he found that he was becoming very skilled and soon he was making some of the finest tacks.\nOld Mr. Smith died and the son because of the war lost all his goods. He had to leave home and settled down in another country. It so happened that in this village there were many shoemakers who were spending a lot of money to buy tacks for their shoes and even at times when they paid high prices they were not always able to get what they wanted, because in that part of the country there was a high demand for soldiers' shoes.\nOur young Mr. Smith, who was finding it difficult to earn his daily bread, remembered that he had learned how to make tacks and had the sudden idea of making a bargain with the shoemakers. He told them that he would make the tacks if they would help to get him settled in his workshop. The shoemakers were only too glad of the offer. And after a while, Mr. Smith found that he was soon making the finest tacks in the village.\n\"How funny it seems,\" he used to say, \"even making tacks can bring a fortune .\"\n\nQ: What can we learn from the young Mr. Smith's success?\n\nA.

Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.\nEstimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.\nWater is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.\nSean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: \"Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable.\"\nBut this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.\nIt is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.\nThere could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.\nProfessor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: \"There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres\".\n\"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.\"\nSo the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life.\n\nQ: What is considered as the symbol of life existence traditionally?\n\nA.

Today, these majestic animals are extensively used to help carry wood for the logging industry. It is therefore nice to hear that on National Elephant Day the mighty mammals are treated like a king, and served with meals fit for a king.\nOne of the biggest celebrations took place at the Pattaya Resort in Thailand's Chonburi Province. Fifty-two elephants, some wearing beautiful clothes, arrived bright and early   for the big day. Each was first blessed with holy water by a professional elephant rider and then led to the grand feast, which served an unlimited supply of their favorite treats--bananas, dragon fruits  , pineapples, assorted melons, apples and the list went on and on!

But isn't it true of people? Can people change themselves? Are we humans just creatures of habits? Do we not have any control over our actions and habits?\nOne guy said, \"Bad habits are like a comfortable bed. They're easy to get into, but hard to get out of.\" Someone else said, \"The chains of habits are too small to feel until they're too strong to break.\" So breaking the mould of our bad habits takes effort.\nHabits are like the roads we take through our life every day. The problem is that not every road takes us where we need to go. Actually, our routes through life often become our ruts   in life. We end up stuck in them and find it hard to dig ourselves out. That's why we must change our bad habits as soon as possible before they become our second nature. You see, our habits become our character and our character becomes our life. As one wise person said, \"First we make our habits, and then our habits make us.\"\nBut we humans don't like to change. So we come up with excuses, like \"I can't be different; that's just the way I am.\" And the good excuse is \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\" But that's just it: we're not dogs or animals. In fact, we're the only creatures who have the freedom and power to change and choose the kind of person we want to become.\n\nQ: The author's attitude towards changing one's bad habits is  _  .\n\nA. doubtful\nB. optimistic\nC. negative\nD. indifferent",

The peacock lived in a tree on the bank of the stream in which the tortoise had his home, and every day the peacock danced near the stream and displayed his gay plumage for the amusement of his friend. \nUnfortunately, one day a bird-catcher caught the peacock and was about to take him away to the market. The unhappy bird begged his captor to allow him to say goodbyeto his friend -- the tortoise. The bird-catcher agreed and took the peacock to the tortoise, who was greatly astonished when he saw his friend become a captive. The tortoise asked the bird-catcher to let the peacock go, but the bird-catcher laughed at his request, saying that was his livelihood.
