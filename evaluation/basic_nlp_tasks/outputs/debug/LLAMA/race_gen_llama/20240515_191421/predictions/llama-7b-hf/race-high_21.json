Californians are feeling the heat after Governor Jerry Brown announced an order that puts mandatory  statewide water cutbacks into effect.\nCalifornia has faced water-use cutbacks in the past. In January 2014, Governor Brown called for residents to curb their water use by 20 percent, but many places around the state failed to meet that goal. This most recent announcement, however, marks the first time in the state's history that mandatory restrictions have been ordered.\nMost of California's water supply comes from the Sierra Nevada mountain range snowpack. Normally, during the spring and summer, this snow melts and puts new supplies into groundwater. but this past winter, the snowpack reached its lowest point since 1950. \"today we are standing on dry grass where there should be feet of snow\" announced Governor Brown.\nAs part of his order, Governor Brown called upon the state Water Resource Control Board to draft emergency rules for water use in the coming month. Cities and towns across the state must cut water usage by 25 percent. If city water agencies fail to meet these targets for water conservation, they could be fined $10,000 a day.\nThe state will also support local governments in replacing 50 million square feet of lawns with drought-tolerant plants that use less water.

Not only are their ears turned to the beats, babies can actually dance to the music.\nTo test babies' dancing ability, the researchers played recordings of classical music, rhythmic beats and speech to infants, and recorded the results. They also invited professional dancers to analyze how well the babies matched their movements to the music. The babies moved their arms, hands, legs feet and heads in response to the music, much more than to the speech.

In experiments with 26 sleeping infants, each just 1 to 2 days old, scientists played a musical tone followed by a puff of air to their eyes 200 times over the course of a half-hour. 124 electrodes  stuck on the head and face of each baby recorded brain activity during the experiments. The babies rapidly learned to foretell a puff of air upon hearing the tone, showing a four-time increase on average in the chances of tightening their eyelids in response to the sound by the end of the experiments.\nAs newborns spend most of their time asleep, this newfound ability might be crucial to rapidly adapting to the world around them and help to ensure their survival, researchers said.\nJudging Characters Well\nJudging another person helpful or harmful is crucial when choosing friends. And that ability starts early. Kiley Hamlin of Yale University showed both 6-and 10-month-olds a puppet  show, in which one character helped another climb a hill. In another scene a third character pushed the climber down. The little ones then got to choose which character they preferred. For both age groups, most babies chose the helper character.

Even at the age of 23, I had gone through my share of dieting. \nI am an emotional eater and I knew that at 5 feet 5 inches tall and 180 pounds, I wasn't at my healthiest. My mother had been doing Weight Watchers for some time and was rapidly seeing results without starving herself. She shared her books with me and explained the program: estimate your daily target based on your weight and other factors, write down everything you eat and move! The longer I stuck to it the more I noticed a difference in the way I enjoyed food. I soon began to like eating fruits and vegetables for snacks instead of chocolate bars and chips. My mother and I went on walks together and kept each other in check. Unsurprisingly, I lost twenty pounds soon and looked amazing in my wedding dress.\nI buy healthy foods, replace ice cream and faithfully keep a food journal. I exercised and take evening walks. Because I have a hard time reaching for something healthy by myself, I bought a Weight Watchers cookbook and use it to prepare our meals. I use small plates and bowls to trick myself into believing there is more food than the serving size. \nIt's been hard to discipline myself not to eat badly. But when I find myself having a desire for strawberries instead of chocolate, I know it's all worthwhile.\n\nQ: The author successfully lost twenty pounds   _  .\n\nA. by walking and eating less every day\nB. by only eating fruits and vegetables\nC. under her doctor's direction\nD. with the help of her mother",
