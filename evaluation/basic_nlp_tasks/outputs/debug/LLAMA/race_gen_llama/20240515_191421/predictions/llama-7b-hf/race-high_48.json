And a story can be told about each of them. \"Hot\" is a simple, easily-understood word. So are most of the expressions made with the word \"hot\".  But not always, as we shall see. \nTake the phrase \"hot potato\" for example. The potato is a popular vegetable in the United States. Many people like baked potatoes, cooked in an oven or fire. Imagine trying to carry a hot, baked potato in your hand. It would be difficult, even painful, to do so. One such hot potato is taxes. Calling for higher taxes can mean defeat for a politician. And yet, if taxes are not raised, some very popular government programs could be cut, which can also make a politician very unpopular. \nAnother expression is \"not so hot\". If you ask someone how she feels, she may answer: \"Not so hot. \" What she means is that she does not feel well. \"Not so hot\" is also a way of saying that you do not really like something. \n\"A hot shot\" is a person, often a young person, who thinks he can do anything. At least he wants to try. He is very sure he can succeed. But often he fails. The expression came from the army. A hot shot was a soldier who fired without aiming carefully.\nA person who becomes angry easily is called \"a hothead\". An angry person's neck often becomes red. We say he is \"hot under the collar\". You could say that your friend is no hothead. But he got hot under the collar when someone took his radio. \nThe hot line was a direct communication link between the leaders of the Soviet Union  and the United States.

Jessica Andrews is one of the few whose dreams have come true.\nAndrews, first taste of success came at the age of 10. She won a talent competition in her home town of Huntingdon, Tennessee, singing I Will Always Love You, originally sung by Whitney Houston.

With Gallimore signed on to produce, Andrews soon had a recording contract  with Dream Works' Nashville label.\nAndrews' professional career was launched with 1999's Heart Shaped World, recorded when she was 14 years old. The album included the country hit I Will Be There For You, which also appeared on The Prince Of Egypt . She followed up the release of the album by touring as a support act for such country superstars as Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood.\nWith the release of 2001's, Who I Am, Andrews became a star in her own right. The album was certified  gold for sales of 500,000 copies. Andrews returned in April 2003 with Now,an album that she promised would show a new side of the young artist. \"This album has a very different feeling for me,\" she said. \"It's a lot more personal and there's a confidence that wasn't quite there on the first two.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, US, say that this may someday be possible.\nA drug remains far off, but researchers have laid a foundation with their discovery that proteins can be removed from the brain's fear center to cut memories forever.\nPrevious research had already shown that a special behavior therapy   could cut painful memories. But relapse   was possible because the memory hadn't necessarily disappeared.\nBy looking at that process, Richard Huganir and Roger Clem, two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, discovered a \"window of vulnerability  \" when proteins are created. The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made. Because the proteins are unstable, they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories.\nResearchers used mice to find the window, but think the process would be the same in humans. They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound. The sound triggered   the creation of the proteins, called calcium-permeable   AMPARS, which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice's brains.\nThe researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling   the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein. They published their report online last month in Science Express.\nTheir research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare.\nKate Farinholt, a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maryland, US, said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory. \"Erasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea, and I can see all sorts of potential ,\" she said.\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions, too.\n\"Completely deleting a memory is a little scary. How do you remove a memory without removing a part of someone's life,\" Farinholt said. \"And is it best to do that, considering that people grow and learn from their experiences?\"\n\nQ: What have researchers at Johns Hopkins University found recently?\n\nA.

But relapse   was possible because the memory hadn't necessarily disappeared.\nBy looking at that process, Richard Huganir and Roger Clem, two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, discovered a \"window of vulnerability  \" when proteins are created. The proteins help signals travel within the brain as painful memories are made. Because the proteins are unstable, they can be easily removed with drugs or behavior therapy to cut memories.\nResearchers used mice to find the window, but think the process would be the same in humans. They used electric shocks to make the mice fear a certain sound. The sound triggered   the creation of the proteins, called calcium-permeable   AMPARS, which formed for a day or two in the fear centers of the mice's brains.\nThe researchers are working on ways to reopen the window by recalling   the painful memory and using drugs to remove the protein. They published their report online last month in Science Express.\nTheir research has drawn interest and concern from experts in mental healthcare.\nKate Farinholt, a mental health expert with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Maryland, US, said many people suffering from a painful event might benefit from erasing a memory. \"Erasing a memory and then everything bad built on that is an amazing idea, and I can see all sorts of potential ,\" she said.\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions, too.\n\"Completely deleting a memory is a little scary. How do you remove a memory without removing a part of someone's life,\" Farinholt said. \"And is it best to do that, considering that people grow and learn from their experiences?\"\n\nQ: What is Kate Farinholt's opinion of the research?\n\nA. People may lose the chance to learn from their bad experiences.\nB. The research will be a great breakthrough in treating painful memories.\nC. People could suffer long-term memory loss.\nD. People could forget happy memories as well.",

More than 3,500 people have successfully climbed the 8,844m mountain, and more than a tenth of that number reached the peak just over the past year. As more and more people try to test themselves against Qomolangma, many a time the mount can be very crowded. Climbers have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks  on the way to the peak. If bad weather strikes, climbers can and do die.\nBut the dangerous crowds aren't the only problem on Qomolangma. All those climbers need to bring a lot of _ --much of them ends up being left on the mountain, sometimes even the peak itself. Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world's tallest rubbish dump. Here's mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma: \"The two standard routes, the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge, are not only dangerously crowded but also badly polluted.\"\nBut the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma. Mountaineer Paul Thelen and his friend Eberhard Schaaf are part of the annual Eco Everest Expedition, which has been cleaning up rubbish from base camps to the peak since 2008. So far they've collected over 13 tons of garbage.\nSome of that rubbish is even being used for a higher purpose. As part of the Mount Everest 8844 Art Project, a group of 15 artists from Nepal collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down the mountain by climbers. They've changed the cans and oxygen tanks--in one case, part of the remains of a helicopter--into 74 pieces of art that have already gone on exhibition in Nepal's capital. Part of the profit from sales will go to the Everest Peakeers Association, which has helped collect tons of rubbish off the mountain.\n\nQ: What do we learn about the bottlenecks on the way to Mount Qomolangma's peak?\n\nA. They are relatively safe.\nB. They are often crowded.\nC. They are very easy to pass.\nD. They are sites of base camps.",
