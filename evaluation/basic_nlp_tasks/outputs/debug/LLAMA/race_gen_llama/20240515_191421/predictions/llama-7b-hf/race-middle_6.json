The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different.\nBut Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh\nWhen he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called \"the Gusundheit Institute\",together with some other doctors. They wanted it to be a place with a different way of working with sick people.\nHunter Adams became famous during the 1980s, and in 1988, Universal Pictures made a film about his life. It was very successful. In the film, Robin Williams played Adams. Williams said,:\"hunter is a really warm person, who believes that patients need a doctor who is a friend. I enjoyed playing him.\"\n\nQ: The passage mainly tells us about\n\nA. how to cheer up patients\nB. people with mental health problems\nC. a film about Adams\nD. a doctor named Hunter Adams",
