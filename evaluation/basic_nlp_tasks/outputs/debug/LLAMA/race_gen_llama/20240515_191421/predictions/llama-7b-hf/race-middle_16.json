At the end of a wonderful meal, Yulya asked if I would like a banana. I politely declined  and thanked her, and explained I was most satisfied with the meal. But my mind was racing: \"What should I do? Should I offer her a banana though they are as close to her as they are to me? What is the polite thing to do?\"\n\"Would you like a banana?\" I asked Yulya.\n\"Yes,\" she smiled, but didn't try to take any of the three bananas in the fruit basket.\n\"Which one would you like?\" I asked again.\n\"That one,\" she pointed at one of the bananas. So thinking about Russian politeness, f picked the banana Yulya had pointed at. Then I _ it half way and handed it to her.Smiles on Yulya's and Nicolai's faces told me I had done the right thing. Alter this experience, I spent much time letting the world know that in Russia, the polite thing was to peel bananas for ladies.\nHowever, sometime during my third trip i learned I was wrong.\n\"Oh no, David,\" a Russian politely corrected me.  \"In Russia, when a man peels a banana for a lady, it means he has a romantic interest in her.\" How embarrassed   I felt.\nSo to communicate properly with people of different cultures, we should watch carefully how people of the same culture communicate with each other.

It is necessary to give him a transfusion   because he has lost much blood in the accident. However, special care must be taken in selecting new blood for him. If the blood is too different from his own, the transfusion can kill him.\nThere are four basic blood groups: A, B, AB and O. A single test can tell us a person's blood group. Everybody is born with one of these four blood groups. People's blood group, like hair colour, is inherited   from parents.\nBecause the substances contained in each group are different, transfusion must be given carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can be given to any other group, so it is often called the universal donor. On the contrary, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient  . However, before being given the transfusion, patients usually receive only salt or plasma   until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible. In this way, it is possible to avoid any bad results of the transfusion.\nThere is a relationship between our blood groups and our nationalities.
