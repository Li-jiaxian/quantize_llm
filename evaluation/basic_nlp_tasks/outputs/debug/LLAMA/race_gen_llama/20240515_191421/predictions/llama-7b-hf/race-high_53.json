Each child (aged 12-13) beatified a box and wrote a story on the subject of collections to throw inside it. The boxes were spread within the Royal Festival Hall's Ballroom. Some were left empty to encourage\nThe subject chosen by Luren was an imaginative one. \"It's a sort o f Cinderella   story,\" she told me, inspired by a collection of letters from her cousin, ha the story these become love letters, burned by a creel stepmother. Lauren's best friend Charlotte is the stepmother. \"I'm in Charlotte's story too,\" says Lauren, \"and I get run over.\" Charlotte's tale was inspired by the girls' coin collection. \"We've collected foreign coins for years - since our families went on holiday to Tenerife.\" she explains. \"That was before the Euro, so we put pesetas in.\" Lauren continues: \"I fred a coin in the road, go to get it and get run over. I'm in hospital and then I die.\" Charlotte adds: \"Or she might not die. I haven't decided yet.\"\nMillie Murray, who is a tea-novel author, thinks that setting the subject of collections was a useful inspiration to their creativity rather than a restriction .  \"In the beginning I thought, 'Will the children be able to do it?'\" she says. \"But it's been fruitful. Some have their own collection, some have parents who do, and some have wlstten complete stories. It's made them think about something they wouldn't have otherwise, winch can only be a good thing.\"\n\nQ: Millie Murray thinks   _  .\n\nA. collections could inspire writing creativity\nB. it was good for parents to have collections\nC. inspirations were very useful in writing stories\nD. setting collection subjects restricted inspirations",

G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.\nWriting in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nOne of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as \"big brother\" and \"doublethink\". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian  government.
